# NeuroMANCER v1.4.1

**Neural Modules with Adaptive Nonlinear Constraints and Efficient Regularizations (NeuroMANCER)**
is an open-source differentiable programming (DP) library for solving parametric constrained optimization problems, 
physics-informed system identification, and parametric model-based optimal control.
NeuroMANCER is written in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and allows for systematic 
integration of machine learning with scientific computing for creating end-to-end 
differentiable models and algorithms embedded with prior knowledge and physics.


### New in v1.4.1
We've made some backwards-compatible changes in order to simplify integration and support multiple symbolic inputs to `nn.Modules` in our `blocks` interface.

**New Colab Examples:**  
> ⭐ [Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in NeuroMANCER](#physics-informed-neural-networks-pinns-for-partial-differential-equations-pdes)

> ⭐ [System identification for ordinary differential equations (ODEs)](#ordinary-differential-equations-odes)

See [v1.4.1 release notes](#version-141-release-notes) for more details.

## Features and Examples

Extensive set of tutorials can be found in the 
[examples](https://github.com/pnnl/neuromancer/tree/master/examples) folder.
Interactive notebook versions of examples are available on Google Colab!
Test out NeuroMANCER functionality before cloning the repository and setting up an
environment.

## Documentation
The documentation for the library can be found [online](https://pnnl.github.io/neuromancer/). 
There is also an [introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkFKz-DgC98) covering 
core features of the library. 


```python 
# Neuromancer syntax example for constrained optimization
import neuromancer as nm
import torch 

# define neural architecture 
func = nm.modules.blocks.MLP(insize=1, outsize=2, 
                             linear_map=nm.slim.maps['linear'], 
                             nonlin=torch.nn.ReLU, hsizes=[80] * 4)
# wrap neural net into symbolic representation via the Node class: map(p) -> x
map = nm.system.Node(func, ['p'], ['x'], name='map')
    
# define decision variables
x = nm.constraint.variable("x")[:, [0]]
y = nm.constraint.variable("x")[:, [1]]
# problem parameters sampled in the dataset
p = nm.constraint.variable('p')

# define objective function
f = (1-x)**2 + (y-x**2)**2
obj = f.minimize(weight=1.0)

# define constraints
con_1 = 100.*(x >= y)
con_2 = 100.*(x**2+y**2 <= p**2)

# create penalty method-based loss function
loss = nm.loss.PenaltyLoss(objectives=[obj], constraints=[con_1, con_2])
# construct differentiable constrained optimization problem
problem = nm.problem.Problem(nodes=[map], loss=loss)
```

## Installation

For either pip or conda installation, first clone the neuromancer package.
A dedicated virtual environment (conda or otherwise) is recommended. 

Note: If you have a previous neuromancer env it would be best at this point to create a new environment given the following instructions.

```bash
git clone -b master https://github.com/pnnl/neuromancer.git --single-branch
```

### PIP Install
Recommended installation.  
Pip installation is broken up into required dependencies for core Neuromancer
and dependencies associated with the examples, tests, and generating the documentation.
Below we give instructions to install all dependencies in a conda virtual enviroment via pip. 
You need at least pip version >= 21.3.

#### Create and activate virtual environment

``` bash
conda create -n neuromancer python=3.10.4
conda activate neuromancer
```

#### Install neuromancer and all dependencies.
From top level directory of cloned neuromancer run:

```bash
pip install -e.[docs,tests,examples]
```

OR, for zsh users:
```zsh
pip install -e.'[docs,tests,examples]'
```

See the `pyproject.toml` file for reference.

``` toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
tests = ["pytest", "hypothesis"]
examples = ["casadi", "cvxpy", "imageio"]
docs = ["sphinx", "sphinx-rtd-theme"]
```

#### Note on pip install with `examples` on MacOS (Apple M1)
Before CVXPY can be installed on Apple M1, you must install `cmake` via Homebrew:

```zsh
brew install cmake
```

See [CVXPY installation instructions](https://www.cvxpy.org/install/index.html) for more details.


### Conda install
Conda install is recommended for GPU acceleration. 
In many cases the following simple install should work for the specified OS

#### Create environment & install dependencies
##### Ubuntu

``` bash
conda env create -f linux_env.yml
conda activate neuromancer
```

##### Windows

``` bash
conda env create -f windows_env.yml
conda activate neuromancer
conda install -c defaults intel-openmp -f
```

##### MacOS (Apple M1)

``` bash
conda env create -f osxarm64_env.yml
conda activate neuromancer
```

##### Other (manually install all dependencies)

!!! Pay attention to comments for non-Linux OS !!!

``` bash
conda create -n neuromancer python=3.10.4
conda activate neuromancer
conda install pytorch pytorch-cuda=11.6 -c pytorch -c nvidia
## OR (for Mac): conda install pytorch -c pytorch
conda config --append channels conda-forge
conda install scipy numpy"<1.24.0" matplotlib scikit-learn pandas dill mlflow pydot=1.4.2 pyts numba
conda install networkx=3.0 plum-dispatch=1.7.3 
conda install -c anaconda pytest hypothesis
conda install cvxpy cvxopt casadi seaborn imageio
conda install tqdm torchdiffeq toml
## (for Windows): conda install -c defaults intel-openmp -f
```

#### Install NeuroMANCER package
From the top level directory of cloned neuromancer
(in the activated environment where the dependencies have been installed):

```bash
pip install -e . --no-deps
```

### Test NeuroMANCER install
Run pytest on the [tests folder](https://github.com/pnnl/neuromancer/tree/master/tests). 
It should take about 2 minutes to run the tests on CPU. 
There will be a lot of warnings that you can safely ignore. These warnings will be cleaned 
up in a future release.

##  Release notes

### Version 1.4.1 Release Notes
+ To simplify integration, interpolation of control input is no longer supported in `integrators.py`
  + The `interp_u` parameter of `Integrator` and subclasses has been deprecated
+ Additional inputs (e.g., `u`, `t`) can now be passed as `*args` (instead of as a single tensor input stacked with `x`) in:
  + `Integrator` and subclasses in `integrators.py`
  + `Block` - new base class for all other classes in `blocks.py`
  + `ODESystem` in `ode.py`
+ New Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) examples for solving PDEs in `/examples/PDEs/`

+ Refactored PSL
  + Better PSL unit testing coverage
  + Consistent interfaces across system types
  + Consistent perturbation signal interface in signals.py
+ Refactored Control and System ID learning using Node and System class (system.py)
  + Classes used for system ID can now be easily interchanged to accommodate downstream control policy learning

###  Version 1.3.2 Release Notes
+ Merged Structured Linear Maps and Pyton Systems Library into Neuromancer
  + The code in neuromancer was closely tied to psl and slim.
  A decision was made to integrate the packages as submodules of neuromancer.
  This also solves the issue of the package names "psl" and "slim" already being taken on PyPI.

*Import changes for psl and slim*

```python
# before
import psl
import slim

# now
from neuromancer import psl
from neuromancer import slim
```

### Version 1.3.1 release notes

+ Corresponding releases of SLiM and PSL packages
  + Make sure to update these packages if updating Neuromancer
  + Release 1.4 will roll SLiM and PSL into core Neuromancer for ease of installation and development
