class AcknowledgementSupport(ABC):
    """
        A class that defines the interface for manual message acknowledgement (receiver acknowledges message to the
        broker).

        Client acknowledgement signals to the event broker the message has been received and processed.
        When all receivers have acknowledged that a message has been delivered, the message is removed
        from the permanent storage on the event broker.

        Acknowledgement, or withholding acknowledgement, has no bearing on flow-control or back-pressure.
