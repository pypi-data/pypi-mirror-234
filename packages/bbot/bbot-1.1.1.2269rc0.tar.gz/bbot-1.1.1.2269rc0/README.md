BBOT (Bighuge BLS OSINT Tool) is a modular, recursive OSINT framework that can execute the entire OSINT workflow in a single command.

BBOT is inspired by [Spiderfoot](https://github.com/smicallef/spiderfoot) but takes it to the next level with features like multi-target scans, lightning-fast asyncio performance, and NLP-powered subdomain mutations. It offers a wide range of functionality, including subdomain enumeration, port scanning, web screenshots, vulnerability scanning, and much more. 

![subdomain-stats-boeing](https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity/bbot/assets/20261699/de0154c1-476e-4337-9599-45a1c5e0e78b)

BBOT typically outperforms other subdomain enumeration tools by 20-25%. To learn how this is possible, see [How It Works](https://www.blacklanternsecurity.com/bbot/how_it_works/).

## Full Documentation [Here](https://www.blacklanternsecurity.com/bbot/).

## Installation ([pip](https://pypi.org/project/bbot/))

Note: Requires Linux and Python 3.9+. For more installation methods including [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/blacklanternsecurity/bbot), see [Installation](https://www.blacklanternsecurity.com/bbot/#installation).

```bash
# stable version
pipx install bbot

# bleeding edge (dev branch)
pipx install --pip-args '\--pre' bbot

bbot --help
```

## Example Commands

Scan output, logs, etc. are saved to `~/.bbot`. For more detailed examples and explanations, see [Scanning](https://www.blacklanternsecurity.com/bbot/scanning).

<!-- BBOT EXAMPLE COMMANDS -->
**Subdomains:**

```bash
# Perform a full subdomain enumeration on evilcorp.com
bbot -t evilcorp.com -f subdomain-enum
```

**Subdomains (passive only):**

```bash
# Perform a passive-only subdomain enumeration on evilcorp.com
bbot -t evilcorp.com -f subdomain-enum -rf passive
```

**Subdomains + port scan + web screenshots:**

```bash
# Port-scan every subdomain, screenshot every webpage, output to current directory
bbot -t evilcorp.com -f subdomain-enum -m nmap gowitness -n my_scan -o .
```

**Subdomains + basic web scan:**

```bash
# A basic web scan includes wappalyzer, robots.txt, and other non-intrusive web modules
bbot -t evilcorp.com -f subdomain-enum web-basic
```

**Web spider:**

```bash
# Crawl www.evilcorp.com up to a max depth of 2, automatically extracting emails, secrets, etc.
bbot -t www.evilcorp.com -m httpx robots badsecrets secretsdb -c web_spider_distance=2 web_spider_depth=2
```

**Everything everywhere all at once:**

```bash
# Subdomains, emails, cloud buckets, port scan, basic web, web screenshots, nuclei
bbot -t evilcorp.com -f subdomain-enum email-enum cloud-enum web-basic -m nmap gowitness nuclei --allow-deadly
```
<!-- END BBOT EXAMPLE COMMANDS -->

## Targets

BBOT accepts an unlimited number of targets via `-t`. You can specify targets either directly on the command line or in files (or both!). Targets can be any of the following:

- `DNS_NAME` (`evilcorp.com`)
- `IP_ADDRESS` (`1.2.3.4`)
- `IP_RANGE` (`1.2.3.0/24`)
- `OPEN_TCP_PORT` (`192.168.0.1:80`)
- `URL` (`https://www.evilcorp.com`)

For more information, see [Targets](https://www.blacklanternsecurity.com/bbot/scanning/#targets-t). To learn how BBOT handles scope, see [Scope](https://www.blacklanternsecurity.com/bbot/scanning/#scope).

## API Keys

Similar to Amass or Subfinder, BBOT supports API keys for various third-party services such as SecurityTrails, etc.

The standard way to do this is to enter your API keys in **`~/.config/bbot/secrets.yml`**:
```yaml
modules:
  shodan_dns:
    api_key: 4f41243847da693a4f356c0486114bc6
  c99:
    api_key: 21a270d5f59c9b05813a72bb41707266
  virustotal:
    api_key: dd5f0eee2e4a99b71a939bded450b246
  securitytrails:
    api_key: d9a05c3fd9a514497713c54b4455d0b0
```

If you like, you can also specify them on the command line:
```bash
bbot -c modules.virustotal.api_key=dd5f0eee2e4a99b71a939bded450b246
```

For details, see [Configuration](https://www.blacklanternsecurity.com/bbot/scanning/configuration/)

## BBOT as a Python library

BBOT exposes a Python API that allows it to be used for all kinds of fun and nefarious purposes, like a [Discord Bot that responds to `/scan evilcorp.com`](https://www.blacklanternsecurity.com/bbot/dev/#bbot-python-library-advanced-usage#discord-bot-example).

**Synchronous**

```python
from bbot.scanner import Scanner

# any number of targets can be specified
scan = Scanner("example.com", "scanme.nmap.org", modules=["nmap", "sslcert"])
for event in scan.start():
    print(event.json())
```

**Asynchronous**

```python
from bbot.scanner import Scanner

async def main():
    scan = Scanner("example.com", "scanme.nmap.org", modules=["nmap", "sslcert"])
    async for event in scan.async_start():
        print(event.json())

import asyncio
asyncio.run(main())
```
