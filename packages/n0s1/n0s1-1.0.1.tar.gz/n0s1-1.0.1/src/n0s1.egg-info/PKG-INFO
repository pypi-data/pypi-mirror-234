Description: # n0s1 - Secret Scanner
        n0s1 (pronounced as nosy, /ˈnōzē/) is an open source secret scanner for Project Management and Issue Tracker tools.
        
        The scanner will traverse all items within the target platform (e.g. Jira or Linear) and find leaked secrets in the ticket's title, body and comments.
        
        The secrets are matched based on an extensible configuration file (regex.toml). The scanner looks for sensitive data such as:
        * Github Personal Access Tokens
        * GitLab Personal Access Tokens
        * AWS Access Tokens
        * PKCS8 private keys
        * RSA private keys
        * SSH private keys
        * npm access tokens
        
        ### Currently supported target platforms:
        * [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)
        * [Linear](https://linear.app/)
        
        ### Usage
        ```bash
        cd src/n0s1
        python3 -m pip install n0s1
        n0s1 jira_scan --server "https://<YOUR_JIRA_SERVER>.atlassian.net" --api-key "<YOUR_JIRA_API_TOKEN>"
        ```
        From source:
        ```bash
        cd src/n0s1
        python3 -m venv n0s1_python
        source n0s1_python/bin/activate
        python3 -m pip install -r ../../requirements.txt
        python3 n0s1.py jira_scan --server "https://<YOUR_JIRA_SERVER>.atlassian.net" --api-key "<YOUR_JIRA_API_TOKEN>"
        deactivate
        ```
