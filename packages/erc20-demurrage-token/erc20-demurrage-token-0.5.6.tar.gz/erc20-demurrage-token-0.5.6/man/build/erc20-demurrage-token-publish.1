.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
This tool generates the appropriate bytecode to store the ERC20 Demurrage Token smartcontract code on an EVM chain, along with the required construction parameters.

Arguments for EVM encoding and interaction with EVM RPC node is handled by the \fBchainlib-eth\fP python package.

Specific arguments for this tool are the \fB--demurrage-level\fP, \fB--redistribution-period\fP and \fB--sink-address\fP arguments.


.SS OPTIONS

.TP
\fB-0\fP
Omit newline to output

.TP
\fB-c \fI\fIconfig_dir\fP\fP, \fB--config \fI\fIconfig_dir\fP\fP
Load configuration files from given directory. All files with an .ini extension will be loaded, of which all must contain valid ini file data.

.TP
\fB--demurrage-level \fI\fIlevel
\fP\fP
Level of decay per minute. See SPECIFYING DEMURRAGE below.

.TP
\fB--dumpconfig \fI\fIformat\fP\fP
Output configuration settings rendered from environment and inputs. Valid arguments are \fIini\fP for ini file output, and \fIenv\fP for environment variable output. See \fBCONFIGURATION\fP.

.TP
\fB-e\fP, \fB--executable-address\fP
Address of an executable code point on the network.

.TP
\fB--env-prefix\fP
Environment prefix for variables to overwrite configuration. Example: If \fB--env-prefix\fP is set to \fBFOO\fP then configuration variable \fBBAR_BAZ\fP would be set by environment variable \fBFOO_BAZ_BAR\fP. Also see \fBENVIRONMENT\fP.

.TP
\fB--fee-limit\fP
Set the limit of execution units for the transaction. If used with \fB-s\fP this may incur actual network token cost. If \fB--fee-price\fP is not explicitly set, the price \fImay\fP be retrieved from the network, and multiplied with this value to define the cost.

.TP
\fB--fee-price\fP
Set fee unit price to offer for the transaction. If used with \fB-s\fP this may incur actual network token cost.

.TP
\fB--height\fP
Block height at which to query state for. Does not apply to transactions.

.TP
\fB-i \fI\fIchain_spec\fP\fP, \fB--chain-spec \fI\fIchain_spec\fP\fP
Chain specification string, in the format <engine>:<fork>:<chain_id>:<common_name>. Example: "evm:london:1:ethereum". Overrides the \fIRPC_CREDENTIALS\fP configuration setting.

.TP
\fB-n \fI\fInamespace\fP\fP, \fB--namespace \fI\fInamespace\fP\fP
Load given configuration namespace. Configuration will be loaded from the immediate configuration subdirectory with the same name.

.TP
\fB--no-logs\fP
Turn of logging completely. Negates \fB-v\fP and \fB-vv\fP

.TP
\fB--nonce\fP
Explicitly set nonce to use for transaction.

.TP
\fB-p\fP, \fB--rpc-provider\fP
Fully-qualified URL of RPC provider. Overrides the \fIRPC_PROVIDER\fP configuration setting.

.TP
\fB--passphrase-file \fI\fIpath\fP\fP
Path to file containing password to unlock key file

.TP
\fB--raw\fP
Produce output most optimized for machines.

.TP
\fB--redistribution-period \fI\fIminutes
\fP\fP
Number of minuntes between each withdrawal of demurraged value is possible.

.TP
\fB--rpc-auth\fP
RPC endpoint authentication method, e.g. how to handle a HTTP WWW-Authenticate header. Overrides the \fIRPC_AUTH\fP configuration setting.

.TP
\fB--rpc-credentials\fP
RPC endpoint authentication data. Format depends on the authentication method defined in \fB--rpc-auth\fP. Overrides the \fIRPC_CREDENTIALS\fP configuration setting.

.TP
\fB--rpc-dialect\fP
RPC backend dialect. If specified it \fImay\fP help with encoding and decoding issues. Overrides the \fIRPC_DIALECT\fP configuration setting.

.TP
\fB-s\fP
Send to network. If set, network state may change. This means tokens may be spent and so on. Use with care. Only applies to transactions.

.TP
\fB--seq\fP
Use numeric sequencial jsonrpc query ids. Useful for buggy server implementations who expects such.

.TP
\fB--sink-address \fI\fIaddress
\fP\fP
Initial address receiving the demurrage value withdrawal.

.TP
\fB-u\fP, \fB--unsafe\fP
Allow addresses that do not pass checksum.

.TP
\fB-v\fP
Verbose. Show logs for important state changes.

.TP
\fB-vv\fP
Very verbose. Show logs with debugging information.

.TP
\fB-w\fP
Wait for the last transaction to be confirmed on the network. Will generate an error if the EVM execution fails.

.TP
\fB-ww\fP
Wait for \fIall\fP transactions sequentially to be confirmed on the network. Will generate an error if EVM execution fails for any of the transactions.

.TP
\fB-y \fI\fIpath\fP\fP, \fB--key-path \fI\fIpath\fP\fP
Path to signing key. Overrides the \fIWALLET_KEY_FILE\fP configuration setting.

.SH CONFIGURATION

All configuration settings may be overriden both by environment variables, or by overriding settings with the contents of ini-files in the directory defined by the \fB-c\fP option.

The active configuration, with values assigned from environment and arguments, can be output using the \fB--dumpconfig\fP \fIformat\fP option. Note that entries having keys prefixed with underscore (e.g. _SEQ) are not actual configuration settings, and thus cannot be overridden with environment variables.

To refer to a configuration setting by environment variables, the \fIsection\fP and \fIkey\fP are concatenated together with an underscore, and transformed to upper-case. For example, the configuration variable \fIFOO_BAZ_BAR\fP refers to an ini-file entry as follows:

.EX
[foo]
bar_baz = xyzzy
.EE

In the \fBENVIRONMENT\fP section below, the relevant configuration settings for this tool is listed along with a short description of its meaning.

Some configuration settings may also be overriden by command line options. Also note that the use of the \fB-n\fP and \fB--env-prefix\fP options affect how environment and configuration is read. The effects of options on how configuration settings are affective is described in the respective \fBOPTIONS\fP section.

.SH SPECIFYING DEMURRAGE

Demurrage is specified as a parts-per-million value in terms of the chosen \fI--redistribution-period\fP.

For example, a value of \fB20000\fP with a \fI--redistribution-period\fP of \fB43200\fP corresponds to a \fB2%\fP demurrage per \fB30\fP days.
.SH ENVIRONMENT


.TP
\fICHAIN_SPEC\fP
String specifying the type of chain connected to, in the format \fI<engine>:<fork>:<network_id>:<common_name>\fP. For EVM nodes the \fIengine\fP value will always be \fIevm\fP.

.TP
\fIRPC_AUTH\fP
Authentication method to use for the \fIRPC_PROVIDER\fP. Currently only \fIbasic\fP is supported.

.TP
\fIRPC_CREDENTIALS\fP
Authentication credentials to use for \fIRPC_AUTH\fP. For \fIbasic\fP authentication the value must be given as \fI<user>:<pass>\fP.

.TP
\fIRPC_DIALECT\fP
Enables translations of EVM node specific formatting and response codes.

.TP
\fIRPC_PROVIDER\fP
Fully-qualified URL to the RPC endpoint of the blockchain node.

.TP
\fIWALLET_KEY_FILE\fP
The wallet key file containing private key to use for transaction signing. Overridden by \fB-y\fP.

.TP
\fIWALLET_PASSPHRASE\fP
Passphrase to unlock wallet. \fBWARNING:\fP it is \fBunsafe\fP to pass the passphrase as an environment variable. If the key unlocks something of value, the passphrase should rather be in a configuration file, preferably as an encrypted entry. Alternatively, a passphrase can be read from file using the \fB--passphrase-file\fP option. Files containing passphrases should only be accessible by the owner.
