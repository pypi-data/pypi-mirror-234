# Metrics
 
```python3
from explainer import metrics
```

Several base metrics are provided for ML/DL classification models. These metrics cover model execution and performance and orient the data scientist to where there is potential for classification bias. 

## Algorithms
Provided with a classfication model's predictions and their corresponding ground truths, staple performance metrics can be calculated to determine prediction behaviors in the real world. These functions leverage scikit-learn and plotly (eventually) to calculate and visualize said metrics, respectively.

## Environment
