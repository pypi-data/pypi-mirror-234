# Quran Detector\Annotator 
The Holy Quran is often quoted in everyday life by Arabic speaking individuals. Quotes are used to express emotions ranging from sympathy to joy and anger as well as in religious sermons, public speeches among others. Many applications can benefit from the automatic detection of verses from the Holy Quran in text. Examples of such applications include: sentiment analyzers, emotion detectors, automatic speech to text transcribers, etc. <br> <br>
The QDetect tool found in this repository, is capable of identifying any Quranic verse or verse fragment that is equal to or greater than 3 words, in any piece of text. The tool is capable of detecting minor typos and even missing words, but it is most efficient when carrying out exact matching. Error detection and missing word detection can be enabled and disabled by the programmer using the code provided here.

The paper describing the approach followed is presented in:

The file 'Using_QDetect.ipynb' found in this repository, contains a detailed guide on how to use the tool.
