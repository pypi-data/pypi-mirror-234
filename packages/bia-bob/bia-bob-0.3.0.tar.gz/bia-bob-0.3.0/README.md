You can initialize Bob like this:

```

It will then respond with a python code snippet that you can execute ([see full example](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/bia-bob/blob/main/demo/analysis_workflow.ipynb)):

```
from skimage.io import imread
import stackview

image = imread('blobs.tif')
stackview.insight(image)
```
