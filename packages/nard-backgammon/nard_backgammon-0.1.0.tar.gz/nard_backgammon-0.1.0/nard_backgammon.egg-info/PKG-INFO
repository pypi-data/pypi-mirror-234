# Nard Game (Backgammon)

#### Common rules
- Players: the game is played by two players
- Tables board of 24 points or spaces; 2 dice; 30 pieces (15 per player)
- Both players throw a die to decide who plays first; the one with the higher die leads off
- Bearing off:
  - Begins once all 15 pieces are in the home quadrant
  - One piece is removed from the point corresponding to the roll of each die
  - If there are no piece on the point corresponding to a die roll, the player must make a legal move with a piece further away
  - If that is not possible, a piece is borne off from the furthest point that is occupied.

## Usage

#### Playing
```python
from nard_backgammon import (
    Nard, 
    NardState, 
    Player, 
    get_random_move, 
    board_to_str)


# If the first_player is None, then the starting
# player is found on the first roll `first_roll()`
game = Nard.new(first_roll_player=Player.WHITE)

while True:

    match game.state:
        # If first_roll_player is None then 
        # NardState is will be FIRST_ROLL at the init
        case NardState.FIRST_ROLL:
            game.first_roll()

        case NardState.PLAYING:
            # get valid moves for active player
            moves = game.get_valid_moves()
            if not moves:
                game.skip()
                continue
            move = get_random_move(moves)
            game.play_move(move)
            print(board_to_str(game))

        case NardState.ENDED:
            print(f'Winner: {game.outcome.winner}')
            break # End game, exit the loop
