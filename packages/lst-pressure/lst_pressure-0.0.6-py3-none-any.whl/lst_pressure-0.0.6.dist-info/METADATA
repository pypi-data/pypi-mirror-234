# Motivation
Observation blocks encompass various time-related constraints, notably the Local Sidereal Time (LST) and solar time windows. As LST and solar time can diverge over a year, there arises a need to query intersecting intervals between them. This library offers a mechanism to index and search these intervals. Additionally, it includes helper functions to normalize LST to solar times, and vice versa.

# Quick start
Install the package from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/lst-pressure/)

```sh
pip install lst-pressure
```

# Local development
Ensure that you have Python v3.8.10 installed on your system, and then initiate the repository for local development with the following commands:

```sh
source env.sh
pipenv install
```

## Testing

To test the codebase, run `pytest` in the terminal. For live testing, use the [`chomp`](https://github.com/guybedford/chomp#install) task runner. Install either via Cargo (Rust), or via NPM (Node.js)

```sh
source env.sh
chomp --watch
```

## Publishing
The publish workflow is described in [.github/workflows/publish.yml](.github/workflows/publish.yml), and is triggered on pushes to the `release` branch. The published package is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/lst-pressure/). Make sure to first increment the version in [setup.py](./setup.py) before pushing to the release branch.
