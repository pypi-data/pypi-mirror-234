::

    >>> from opv.objects import Object, read, write

DESCRIPTION

::


    OPV is a python3 object that tries to provide JSON dump/load, it
    factors the methods of the base class out into functions to provide
    a clean namespace (no methods in __dict__.

    Standard dict functions are provided for the objects as well as 
    a seperate copy constructor. A storage class that manages objects
    stored in a dedicated directory is also there, as well as basic
    db functions like find (locate objects).

    Object are stamped with a type/uuid/date/time stamp to provided
    identity to objects.

    A dedicated ObjectDecoder/ObjectEncoder should provide dump and
    loading of inherited classes (working on it).
