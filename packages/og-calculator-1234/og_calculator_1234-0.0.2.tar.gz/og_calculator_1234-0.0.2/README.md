# What does this calculator do
A calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and nth root. It stores the result of each calculation in memory, which can also be reset to 0.
User first selects the operator (+, -, *, /, nth root, reset memory, get memory), then inputs a new number. The calculation is made between the number stored in memory and the new number input by the user.
If the user selects get memory or reset memory then they do not need to input a new number.
If the user tries to divide by 0 or calculate nth root of a negative number then the calculator will return an error message.
