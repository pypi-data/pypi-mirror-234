## Development

### Integration testing

Integration tests are located in `src/tests/integration`. The following tools need to be available to run the
integration tests:

* Cargo (to test Cargo building and publishing) *The Cargo integration tests run against Artifactory and Cloudsmith
and requires credentials to temporarily create a new Cargo repository (available in CI).*
* Docker (used to setup services that we run integration tests against)
* Helm (to test Helm packaging and publishing)
* Poetry (to test Python publishing and installing)
* [Slap](https://github.com/python-slap/slap-cli) (to test Python publishing and installing)

__Test a single integration test__

```
PYTEST_FLAGS="--log-cli-level DEBUG -s -k <test_filter>" kraken run pytestIntegration -v
```

The integration tests create temporary files that need to be mounted into a Docker container. If you are running
the integration tests in a Coder workspace, you may need to set `TMPDIR=$HOME/tmp` as the workspaces often only
share the home volume with the Docker-in-Docker container.

### Pull Requests

By default, Pull Requests require a changelog entry to be added via the `slap changelog add` command. If no changelog
entry was added, CI will fail. Some changes are not relevant to consumers of the API that they do not need to be
recorded in the changelog, such as typos in the README. In such cases, the `no changelog` label can be added to the
Pull Request.
