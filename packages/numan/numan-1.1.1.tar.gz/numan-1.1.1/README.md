# numan : Numerosity analysis
Numan is a Python library for a project aiming to identify the neural correlates of numerosity
abilities in zebrafish. The broad project aims to test the hypothesis that the ability to represent numerosity has an evolutionarily conserved neural basis and to identify the cellular and molecular processes involved. In particular, using a 2P Light-Sheet microscope, we recorded the whole-brain GCaMP activity in zebrafish larvae in response to a change in the number of visual stimuli and we aim to find a set of neurons/activity patterns that is characteristic of a specific number presented to the fish.

Numan contains only the analysis tools and relies on [vodex](https://github.com/LemonJust/vodex) for data management.
