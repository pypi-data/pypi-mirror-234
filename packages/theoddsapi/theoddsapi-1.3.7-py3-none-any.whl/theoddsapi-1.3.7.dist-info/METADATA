# the-odds-api-client
Python wrapper for The Odds API V4

## Getting Started

You can install the package using

```
pip install theoddsapi
```

Or you can run the following

```
git clone git@github.com:MidpriceDog/the-odds-api-client.git
```

and then 

```
make install
```

Either way, it is assumed you have Python 3, git, and pip installed.

## Example Usage

Instantiate an instance of `TheOddsAPI` by passing in an API key, which you 
should receive via email upon signing up for a subscription plan [here](!https://the-odds-api.com/).

```python
client = TheOddsAPI('YOUR_KEY_HERE')
```

Let's say you want to find out what the spread odds were on Fanduel's sportbook for games played on the 1st of January in the year 2023 around 12:00 UTC. Then, you would run the following:

```python
self._test_get_historical_odds(
            sport='basketball_nba',
            regions='us',
            markets='spreads',
            date='2023-01-01T12:00:00Z',
            bookmakers='fanduel',
            oddsFormat='american')
```
