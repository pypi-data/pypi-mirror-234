Description-Content-Type: text/markdown

This package is a Python version of MATLAB TOOLBOX -- SOSTOOLS. 

This package contains functions based on **sympy** package. However, in case of a large number of decision variables, **sympy** may take a long time to parse the data.

Demos are in the folder [SOSPy_demos](https://github.com/zm2404/SOSPy/tree/main/SOSPy_demos/Sympy_demos).

### Updates in version 0.1.11:
- Fix bugs in findsos().
- Warning: for solvers in sossolve(), although SCS is installed and can be used by **cvxpy**, it may not work properly.

### Updates in version 0.1.10:
- Print latex form of the solution when calling **sosgetsol()**.
- Adjust the logic of changing solvers when one encounters failure.

### Updates in version 0.1.9:

- Fixed some bugs
- When creating an SOS program, the code searches for and prints out all installed and available solvers.
- We have added **cvxpy** as a solver. As a result, users can now utilize other solvers through **cvxpy**.
- The solvers we currently support are **mosek** and **cvxpy**.
- It's worth noting that since **cvxpy** acts as a parser, certain results cannot be read after executing with **cvxpy**.
This includes details like the **iteration number**, **primal infeasible**, and **dual infeasible**.
