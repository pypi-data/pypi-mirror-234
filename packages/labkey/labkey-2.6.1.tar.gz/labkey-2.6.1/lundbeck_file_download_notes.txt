- make assay with file field in assay results
- make python script to download said file
- the crux here is converting the "url" attribute of the column in the select rows response to something
that our labkey api can use to download the file
    - Storing the file in memory should be fine
    - Storing in /tmp may be better because this will be done in Docker, and if it's on disk it can
    be streamed which should theory be better perf-wise
