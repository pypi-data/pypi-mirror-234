# Basic Subscriber

If you know nothing about *RabbitMQ* and how it works, you will still able to use **FastStream RabbitBroker**.

Just use the `#!python @broker.subscriber(...)` method with a string as a routing key.

```python linenums="1"
from faststream import FastStream
from faststream.rabbit import RabbitBroker

broker = RabbitBroker()
app = FastStream(broker)


@broker.subscriber("routing_key")  # handle messages by routing key
async def handle(msg):
    print(msg)


@app.after_startup
async def test_publish():
    await broker.publish(
        "message",
        "routing_key",  # publish message with routing key
    )
```

This is the principle all **FastStream** brokers work by: you don't need to learn them in-depth if you want to *just send a message*.

## RabbitMQ Details

If you are already familiar with *RabbitMQ* logic, you should also be acquainted with the inner workings of the example mentioned above.

In this case, **FastStream** either creates or validates a queue with a specified **routing_key** and binds it to the default *RabbitMQ* exchange.

If you want to specify a *queue*-*exchange* pair with additional arguments, **FastStream** provides you with the ability to do so. You can use special `RabbitQueue` and `RabbitExchange` objects to configure RabbitMQ queues, exchanges, and binding properties. For examples of using various types of exchanges, please refer to the following articles.
