Summary:  This Algorithm implements a version of a process model repair Algorithm inspired by the paper "Repairing process models to reflect reality" by Dirk Fahland and Wil van der Aalst. DOI: 10.1016/j.is.2013.12.007. This implementation was created by Durborough on GitHub. I only added the setup.py file to make it installable via pip.
