Multiplexing interface for the CMU Pocket Sphinx engine

class SphinxTimerManager(DelegateTimerManager):
    """
        Timer manager for the CMU Pocket Sphinx engine.

        This class allows running timer functions if the engine is
        currently processing audio via one of three engine processing
        methods:

         - :meth:`process_buffer`
         - :meth:`process_wave_file`
         - :meth:`do_recognition`

        .. note ::

           Long-running timers will block Dragonfly from processing what
           was said, so be careful how you use them!

           Audio frames will not normally be dropped because of timers,
           long-running or otherwise.
