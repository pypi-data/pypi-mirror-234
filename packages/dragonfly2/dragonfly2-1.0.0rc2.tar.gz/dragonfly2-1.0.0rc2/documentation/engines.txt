Engines sub-package
============================================================================

Dragonfly supports multiple speech recognition engines as its backend.
The *engines* sub-package implements the interface code for each
supported engine.

Also contained within this sub-package are a number of text-to-speech
implementations.  These can be used independently of the speech recognition
engines via the ``get_speaker()`` function.
