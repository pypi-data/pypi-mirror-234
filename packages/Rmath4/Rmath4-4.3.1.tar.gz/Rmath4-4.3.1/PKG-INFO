Rmath4-python
============

This is the [standalone Rmath library from R][Rmath-4] for Python. It is based on
the [Rmath-julia] library but does not alter the random number generation.

This is an updated version, including some patches for warning messages, based on [https://github.com/ntessore/Rmath-python][Nick Tessore's work].


Installation
------------

The package is available for pip installation:

    pip install Rmath4

Alternatively, you can clone or download this repository, and install from
there in the usual way.

In either case, a functional build system is required, but there are no
dependencies.


Updating the Library
--------------------

To update to the latest version of R, bump the `RVERSION` file, and run `make
update`. Some additional manual changes to the headers may be necessary: these
should go in `include/Rconfig.h`. Additional manual updates for the `nmath.h` patches for the warning messages may be required.
