Changelog
=========


2.1.0 (2023-10-09)
==================

Fixed
-----
- Handle token expiration when there is no ``refresh_token`` or no token URL
  (:issue:`39`)

Changed
-------
- Restore the ``OVERWRITE_REDIRECT_URI`` configuration option as
  ``OIDC_OVERWRITE_REDIRECT_URI``.
- The ``redirect_uri`` that is generated and sent to the ID provider is no longer
  forced to HTTPS, because the `the OIDC spec`_ is actually only a strong
  recommendation (:issue:`35`). You can use ``OVERWRITE_REDIRECT_URI`` if you want
  to force it to HTTPS (or any other URL).


2.0.3 (2023-09-08)
==================

Fixed
-----

- Use the ``OIDC_CALLBACK_ROUTE`` with the ID provider when it is defined,
  instead of the default (:issue:`21`)
- Auto-renew tokens when they have expired (if possible), as version 1.x used
  to do (:issue:`19`)

Changed
-------

- The ``redirect_uri`` that is generated and sent to the ID provider is always
  HTTPS, as `the OIDC spec`_ mandates.
- Don't request the ``profile`` scope by default, as version 1.x used to do
  (:issue:`21`).

.. _the OIDC spec: https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest



2.0.2 (2023-08-23)
==================

Fixed
-----

- Avoid a redirect loop on logout when the token is expired (:issue:`17`).


Deprecated
----------

- Configuration option ``OIDC_USERINFO_URL`` (and the ``userinfo_uri`` key in
  ``client_secrets``) (:issue:`15`).


2.0.1 (2023-08-22)
==================

This is a bugfix release.

Fixed
-----

- Don't crash if the ``client_secrets`` don't contain a ``userinfo_uri`` key
  (:issue:`13`).
- Handle older versions of Werkzeug.


2.0.0 (2023-08-21)
==================

This is a major release that rebases the Flask OIDC API on `Authlib`_

.. _Authlib: https://authlib.org/


Removed
-------

- Custom callback with the :meth:`~flask_oidc.OpenIDConnect.custom_callback`
  decorator
- Registration has been moved to the If the `oidc-register package`_
- Configuration option ``OIDC_GOOGLE_APPS_DOMAIN``
- Configuration option ``OIDC_VALID_ISSUERS``
- Configuration option ``OIDC_REQUIRE_VERIFIED_EMAIL``
- Configuration option ``OIDC_RESOURCE_CHECK_AUD``
- The following parameters of the :class:`~flask_oidc.OpenIDConnect`
  constructor have been removed:

  - ``credentials_store``
  - ``http``
  - ``time``
  - ``urandom``

.. _oidc-register package: https://pypi.org/project/oidc-register/


Deprecated
----------

- Configuration option ``OIDC_OPENID_REALM``
- Configuration option ``OIDC_CALLBACK_ROUTE``
- Configuration option ``OVERWRITE_REDIRECT_URI``
- The following configuration options have been removed because the
  functionality is now handled by Authlib:

  - ``OIDC_ID_TOKEN_COOKIE_NAME``
  - ``OIDC_ID_TOKEN_COOKIE_PATH``
  - ``OIDC_ID_TOKEN_COOKIE_TTL``
  - ``OIDC_COOKIE_SECURE``

- The :meth:`~flask_oidc.OpenIDConnect.user_getinfo` and
  :meth:`~flask_oidc.OpenIDConnect.user_getfield` methods are deprecated,
  you'll find all the user information in the session:
  ``session["oidc_auth_profile"]``.
  If you need to get the user information using a specific token, you can
  do so by calling ``g._oidc_auth.userinfo(token=token)``.
- The :meth:`~flask_oidc.OpenIDConnect.logout` method is deprecated, just
  redirect to the ``/logout`` view.


Changed
-------

The callback route (aka "redirect URL") is not configurable with
``OIDC_CALLBACK_ROUTE`` anymore. It is always ``/authorize``, but a prefix can
be configured when instanciating the :class:`~flask_oidc.OpenIDConnect`
extension (or calling its :meth:`~flask_oidc.OpenIDConnect.init_app` method::

    app = Flask(__name__)
    openid = OpenIDConnect(app, prefix="/oidc")
    # The OIDC redirect URL will be /oidc/authorize

This will also give you ``/login`` and ``/logout`` views, prefixed identically.

The ``OIDC_SCOPES`` configuration value should now be a string, where the
scopes are separated with spaces.

The minimum Python version is ``3.8``.


Added
-----

The :meth:`~flask_oidc.OpenIDConnect.accept_token` decorator now accepts a
``scopes`` parameter, which is a list of scopes that the provided token must
include for the view to be authorized. It is an Authlib `ResourceProtector`_.

.. _ResourceProtector: https://docs.authlib.org/en/latest/flask/2/resource-server.html

The Authlib app is available in the ``g._oidc_auth`` variable. This means that
there cannot be more than one :meth:`~flask_oidc.OpenIDConnect` extension on a
given Flask application. If you need more, we advise you to use
Authlib directly.
