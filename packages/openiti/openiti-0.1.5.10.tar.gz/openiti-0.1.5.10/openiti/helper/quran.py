Normalize Qur'an text in a safe way. 

Example:
    >>> from quran import special_letters_regex, normalise_quran
    >>> text_tokens = re.split("\s+", text)
    >>> for tok in text_tokens:
            if re.findall(special_letters_regex, tok):
                n = normalise_quran(tok, post_process=True)
                text = re.sub(tok, n, text)


IMPORTANT: post-correction step will affect non-Quranic text as well!
Use the post-processing of the normalise_quran function only on 
tokens / sections that are positively identified as Qur'an text.

This module contains both a function to normalise Qur'an text
(normalise_quran) and the functions used to create the normalisation procedure.

The way the normalisation procedure was devised was 
to compare the traditional spelling of the text (the so-called "uthmani" spelling)
to a standardized version (the "simple" or "imlāʾī" version of the tanzil.net Qur'ān)
and to build a procedure to convert the traditional spelling to the new one. 

The procedure consists of:
* converting non-standard combinations of characters into standard characters;
* denoising: removing all (remaining) non-standard characters;
* fixing a number of inconsistencies in the traditional spelling / in standard practise (e.g., 
  many words are written with a dagger alif in the traditional spelling and normal alif in standard spelling, 
  but some words like Allāh, lākin and raḥmān are also written with dagger alif in standard spelling)

The procedure was created as follows:
* both texts were tokenized in such a way that each token in the Uthmani version 
  corresponds to a token in the simplified version (e.g., "yĀdam", "yā Ādam")
* a list of characters that is only present in the Uthmani version was made
* For each of those characters, a sample of all its contexts (n characters before/after) was 
  extracted from the Uthmani and simplified tokens
* based on the comparison between both, conversion rules were created
* Finally, a script went through the Uthmani text token by token 
  and checked if applying those rules generated the simplified tokens; 
  if not, the rules were changed or the inconsistency was solved by adding the token to a list of exceptions

NB: The result is near perfect. Only in the case of one token (تَدۡعُواْ), 
which has different spellings in the simplified version (تدعو - تدعوا)
for the same spellling in the Uthmani version (تَدۡعُواْ), 
changing the rules and using the exceptions approach
does not result in a consistent transcription. 
One possibility is adding a post-postprocessing step that corrects 
the reading of the one occurrence of the token where it is written
without alif (using the previous and next word).


Texts used:
* simplified version ("imlāʾī" script: standard Arabic grammar and script rules): tanzil.net/download, quran-simple-clean.txt (also tested with quran-simple.txt)
* Uthmani version: https://github.com/risan/quran-json/blob/main/dist/quran.json

Further checks with the Qur'ān texts from the OpenITI corpus showed that they, too,
have only minimal changes from the Uthmani text when normalised with this script
(in addition to the token mentioned: an extra space in baʿda mā,
and a different choice for an alif maksūra / alif in three tokens)
