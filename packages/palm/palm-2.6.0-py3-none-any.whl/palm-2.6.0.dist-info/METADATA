# Palm CLI: The extensible CLI at your fingertips

_Palm_ is a universal CLI developed to improve the life and work of data professionals.

[Palm CLI documentation](https://palm-cli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Installing Palm

```bash
pip install palm
```

**note for mac users**: if you get this warning:

```bash
  WARNING: The script palm is installed in '/Users/yourname/Library/Python/3.8/bin' which is not on PATH.
  Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress this warning, use --no-warn-script-location.
```

you will need to add `'/Users/yourname/Library/Python/3.8/bin'` to your path for `palm` to work.

you can do that with this command:

```bash
echo "\nexport PATH=$PATH:/Users/yourname/Library/Python/3.8/bin\n" >> ~/.zprofile
```

### Upgrading palm

To upgrade palm to the latest version, use `pip install palm -U`

### Requirements

1. You will need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
   You can check to see if you already have it with `docker --version`

2. You will need [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   You can check to see if you already have it with `python3 --version`

### Developing palm

**If you have the repo on your computer** This will install whatever version you have checked out at the moment.

```bash
cd path/to/this/repo &&
python3 -m pip uninstall palm || true # for new installs
python3 -m pip install .
```

You can verify the install with

```bash
