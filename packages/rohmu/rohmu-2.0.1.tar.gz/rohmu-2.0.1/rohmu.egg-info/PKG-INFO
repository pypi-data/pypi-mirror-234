Rohmu is a Python library for building backup tools for databases
providing functionality for compression, encryption and transferring
data between the database and an object storage. Rohmu supports main
public clouds such as GCP, AWS and Azure for backup storage. Rohmu is
used in various backup tools such as
`PGHoard <https://github.com/aiven/pghoard>`__ for PostgreSQL,
`MyHoard <https://github.com/aiven/myhoard>`__ for MySQL and
`Astacus <https://github.com/aiven/astacus>`__ for M3 and ClickHouse and
other databases.

Features
========

-  Supported object storages: Azure, GCP, S3, Swift (OpenStack), local
   file storage and SFTP.
-  Supported compression algorithms: Snappy,
   `zstd <https://github.com/facebook/zstd>`__ and
   `lzma <https://docs.python.org/3/library/lzma.html>`__.
