    """
    A disjoint-set data structure, also called union-find.

    A disjoint-set, is a set of disjoint sub-sets (sets with empty
    intersections). In other words, a disjoint-set is a set of elements
    (elements are unordered and unique), split/partitioned into multiple
    sub-sets, each of which is disjoint with all other sub-sets, such that any
    given element of the whole disjoint-set is part of one, and only one, of
    its sub-sets.

    It provides two main operators;
    - unioning (merging) disjoint sub-sets,
    - and finding the root of a disjoint sub-set,
      where the root is a unique representative member
      of sub-set that identifies it from other sub-sets,

    hence the alternative name; union-find.

    Each disjoint sub-set is represented by its root, and all other elements
    in the same sub-set are stored in a tree structure that connects them to
    their root. This makes it easy to determine if any two elements are in the
    same or different sub-sets. This is because finding which sub-set an
    element is a member of reduces to simply finding its root, and since the
    tree structure contains a trivially traceable path from each element to
    its sub-set's root. This path is (usually) compressed as the disjoint-set
    is modified, making it easier to find an element's root on future look-ups.

    The second benefit of the tree-based representation of a disjoint-set is,
    that union operations are trivial. This is because performing the union
    of two sub-sets requires only setting the parent of the root of one
    sub-set to be the root of the other sub-set. This is a single operation
    (which is constant time), which relies on two root find operations (one to
    find the root of each sub-set). Although union operations may make root
    finding more expensive (because they can make the trees grow), if the
    union is done intelligently (whereby the tree depths do not grow linearly
    with the size of the disjoint set), and path compression is used
    appropriately, root finding becomes constant amortised time and therefore
    union operations are also constant time.

    The alternative representation, would be to explicitly keep track of the
    root of each element of the disjoint-set. Unfortunately, whilst this would
    make root finding always constant time, union operations would be linear
    time (in the size of the disjoint-set) since unioning two sets would
    involve reassigning the root of all elements of one of the two sets.

    This implementation also supports tracking of sub-sets. This is useful if
    the disjoint sub-sets need to be accessed many times and the disjoint-set
    will be updated often. This is unlike caching the disjoint sub-sets when
    then are accessed, because the cache is usually invalidated when the
    disjoint-set is updated (with an add or a union). Accessing the disjoint
    sub-sets when they are not tracked is computationally expensive, but it
    saves memory during operation and updates are less expensive. Tracking the
    sets uses more memory during operation and is more computationally
    expensive during updates, but accessing the disjoint sub-sets is trivial.

    Example Usage
    -------------
    ```
    from aloy.datastructures.disjointset import DisjointSet

    # Construct a disjoint-set with integer elements from
    # an iterable, its is initially fully-disjoint, such that
    # no two elements are in the same sub-set.
    dset: DisjointSet[int] = DisjointSet([i for i in range(5)])

    >>> dset
    DisjointSet({0: {0}, 1: {1}, 2: {2}, 3: {3}, 4: {4}})
    >>> str(dset)
    'Disjoint-Set: total elements = 5, total disjoint sub-sets = 5'

    # A simple union operation unions the sub-sets
    # containing the given elements into one new sub-set,
    # returning the root of the new sub-set.
    >>> dset.union(3, 4)
    4
    >>> dset
    DisjointSet({0: {0}, 1: {1}, 2: {2}, 4: {3, 4}})

    # Many elements can be unioned simultaneously.
    dset.union_many(0, 1, 2)
    >>> dset
    DisjointSet({1: {0, 1, 2}, 4: {3, 4}})

    # Elements 0, 1 and 2 are now in the same sub-set, therefore
    # they have the same root, and are considered connected.
    >>> dset.find_root(2)
    1
    >>> dset.find_root(0)
    1
    >>> dset.is_connected(0, 2)
    True
    >>> dset.is_connected(0, 4)
    False

        A root, is a set element, whose parent is itself.

        This method finds roots via an iterative search, and if
        compression is enabled, iteratively compresses the path
        from the given element to the root, such that the parents
        of all non-root elements on the path, will be the root.

        Parameters
        ----------
        `element: ST@DisjointSet` - The element whose root to find.

        `compress: bool = True` - Whether to fully compress the path
        from the given node to its root. This more expensive operation
        will speed up future lookups for elements on the same path.

        Returns
        -------
        `ST@DisjointSet` - The root of the sub-set containing the given
        element.

        Raises
