+ Comments: Nowadays, the strong changes in the Brazil government, the names 
downloaded with brazilapi is lacking names, such as, Lula. 
So, I have merged the wikidata names with the other file downloaded from brazilapi. 
From my point of view, Brazilapi could be a good work with the government more stable
The current file has more than 5000 names, so by number is good and the sources are good.

If you don't need frequencies, other option would be download the file scraped by 
other people (see the next section)
