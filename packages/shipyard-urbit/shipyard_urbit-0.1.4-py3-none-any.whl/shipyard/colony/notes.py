# Here is an example of how you could use ansible_runner in Python to run a set of playbooks for a specific Linux distribution. This example assumes that you have already installed ansible_runner and created a set of playbooks that you want to run.

# First, import the required modules:

import ansible_runner
from ansible_runner.exceptions import AnsibleRunnerException
# Next, specify the path to the directory containing your playbooks, and the tag for the Linux distribution you want to run the playbooks on:

playbook_dir = '/path/to/playbook/directory'
distro_tag = 'ubuntu'
# Then, create an instance of the Runner class from the ansible_runner module, and specify the playbook directory and the tag for the Linux distribution:

runner = ansible_runner.Runner(
    playbook_dir=playbook_dir,
    playbook_tags=[distro_tag]
)
# Finally, run the playbooks by calling the run() method of the Runner instance:

try:
    result = runner.run()
    print('Playbook run was successful')
except AnsibleRunnerException as e:
    print('An error occurred while running the playbook: {}'.format(e))
# This code will run all of the playbooks in the specified directory that are tagged with the specified Linux distribution. You can adjust the code as needed to fit your specific requirements.
