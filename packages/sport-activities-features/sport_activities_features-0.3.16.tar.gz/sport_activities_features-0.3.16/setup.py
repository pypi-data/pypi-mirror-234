In this captivating journey, we embark on a quest to extract the deepest insights from the wealth of information generated by monitoring sports activities. Brace yourself for a framework that transcends the limitations of conventional analysis techniques. 💪🔍\n\nTraditional approaches often rely on integral metrics like total duration, total distance, and average heart rate, but they fall victim to the dreaded "overall metrics problem." These metrics fail to capture the essence of sports activities, omitting crucial components and leading to potentially flawed and misleading conclusions. They lack the ability to recognize distinct stages and phases of the activity, such as the invigorating warm-up, the endurance-testing main event, and the heart-pounding intervals. ⏱️🚴\u200d♀️📈\n\nFortunately, our sport-activities-framework rises above these limitations, revealing a comprehensive panorama of your sports activity files. This framework combines the power of identification and extraction methods to unlock a treasure trove of valuable data. Picture this :camera: : effortlessly identifying the number of hills, extracting average altitudes of these remarkable formations, measuring the total distance conquered on those inclines, and even deriving climbing ratios for a true measure of accomplishment (total distance of hills vs. total distance). But that\'s just the tip of the iceberg! The framework seamlessly integrates a multitude of extensions, including historical weather parsing, statistical evaluations, and ex-post visualizations that bring your data to life. 🗻📊🌦️\n\nFor those seeking to venture further, we invite you to explore the realms of scientific papers on data mining that delve into these captivating topics. Discover how our framework complements the world of generating and predicting automated sport training sessions, creating a harmonious synergy between theory and practice. 📚🔬💡\n\n## Detailed insights 🔍\n\nPrepare to be astounded by the capabilities of the sport-activities-features framework.

Unveil the heartbeat of your performance! 🏃\u200d♀️📊💓 ([See example](examples/draw_map_with_identified_intervals.py))\n\n- **Calculate the training loads**: Dive deep into the intricate world of training loads and discover the Banister TRIMP and Lucia TRIMP methods. Gain invaluable insights into optimizing your training regimen. 📈⚖️🏋️\u200d♂️ ([See example](examples/calculate_training_load.py))\n\n- **Weather the storm**: Unlock the power of historical weather data from external services, adding a fascinating layer of context to your sports activities. ☀️🌧️⛈️\n\n- **Unveil the secrets within coordinates**: Explore the integral metrics of your activities within specific geographical areas, uncovering valuable data on distance, heart rate, and speed. Peer into the depths of your performance! 🌍📍📉 ([See example](examples/extract_data_inside_area.py))\n\n- **Embrace randomness**: Extract activities from CSV files and indulge in the excitement of randomly selecting a specific number of activities. Embrace the element of surprise! 🎲📂🎉 ([See example](examples/extract_random_activities_from_csv.py))\n\n- **Conquer the dead ends**: Unravel the mysteries of your sports activities by identifying the dead ends. Prepare to navigate the uncharted territories of your performance! 🚧🗺️🔍 ([See example](examples/dead_end_extraction.py))\n\n- **Unlock the format**: Seamlessly convert TCX files to GPX, opening doors to even more possibilities. Adapt and conquer! ⚙️🔄✨ ([See example](examples/convert_tcx_to_gpx.py))\n\nAnd that\'s just the beginning! The sport-activities-framework holds countless other features, awaiting your exploration. Brace yourself for an exhilarating journey of discovery, where the ordinary becomes extraordinary, and your sports activities come alive like never before. 🌟🔥🏃\u200d♂️\n\nThe framework comes with two (testing) [benchmark datasets](https://github.com/firefly-cpp/sports-activity-dataset-collections), which are freely available to download from: [DATASET1](http://iztok-jr-fister.eu/static/publications/Sport5.zip), [DATASET2](http://iztok-jr-fister.eu/static/css/datasets/Sport.zip).\n\n\n## Installation\n\n### pip\n\nInstall sport-activities-features with pip:\n\n```sh\npip install sport-activities-features\n```\n\n### Alpine Linux\n\nTo install sport-activities-features on Alpine, use:\n\n```sh\n$ apk add py3-sport-activities-features\n```\n\n### Fedora Linux\n\nTo install sport-activities-features on Fedora, use:\n\n```sh\n$ dnf install python3-sport-activities-features\n```\n\n### Arch Linux\n\nTo install sport-activities-features on Arch Linux, please use an [AUR helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AUR_helpers):\n\n```sh\n$ yay -Syyu python-sport-activities-features\n```\n\n## API\n\nThere is a simple API for remote work with the sport-activities-features package available [here](https://github.com/alenrajsp/sport-activities-features-api).\n\n## Graphical User Interface\n\nThere is a simple Graphical User Interface for the sport-activities-features package available [here](https://github.com/firefly-cpp/sport-activities-features-gui).\n\n## Historical weather data\nWeather data parsed is collected from the [Visual Crossing Weather API](https://www.visualcrossing.com/).\nPlease note that this is an external unaffiliated service, and users must register to use the API.\nThe service has a free tier (1000 Weather reports/day) but is otherwise operating on a pay-as-you-go model.\nFor pricing and terms of use, please read the [official documentation](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-data-editions) of the API provider.\n\n## Overpass API & Open Elevation API integration\nWithout performing activities, we can use the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) for the identification of hills,\ntotal ascent, and descent. This is done using the [Overpass API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API)\nwhich is a read-only API that allows querying of OSM map data. In addition to that altitude, data is retrieved by using the\n[Open-Elevation API](https://open-elevation.com/) which is an open-source and free alternative to the Google Elevation API.\nBoth of the solutions can be used by using free publicly acessible APIs ([Overpass](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API), [Open-Elevation](https://open-elevation.com/#public-api)) or can be self hosted on a server or as a Docker container ([Overpass](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Installation), [Open-Elevation](https://github.com/Jorl17/open-elevation/blob/master/docs/host-your-own.md)).\n\n## CODE EXAMPLES:\n\n### Reading files\n\n#### (*.TCX)\n```python\nfrom sport_activities_features.tcx_manipulation import TCXFile\n\n# Class for reading TCX files\ntcx_file=TCXFile()\ndata = tcx_file.read_one_file("path_to_the_file") #
