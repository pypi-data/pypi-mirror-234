    """Dice score for binary classification between y_true and y_predicted.

    Args:
        true_key: The key of the ground truth mask.
        pred_key: The key of the prediction values.
        threshold: The threshold for binarizing the prediction.
        mode: What mode(s) to execute this Trace in. For example, "train", "eval", "test", or "infer". To execute
            regardless of mode, pass None. To execute in all modes except for a particular one, you can pass an argument
            like "!infer" or "!train".
        ds_id: What dataset id(s) to execute this Trace in. To execute regardless of ds_id, pass None. To execute in all
            ds_ids except for a particular one, you can pass an argument like "!ds1".
        output_name: What to call the output from this trace (for example in the logger output).
        per_ds: Whether to automatically compute this metric individually for every ds_id it runs on, in addition to
            computing an aggregate across all ds_ids on which it runs. This is automatically False if `output_name`
            contains a "|" character.
