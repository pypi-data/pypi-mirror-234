## 2. Installation <a name="installation"></a>

To use Secpar, follow these installation steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone Secpar repository to your local machine:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/scraper.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary Python dependencies by navigating to the repository directory and running:

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Configuration**: Set up your GitHub repository and obtain a GitHub access token.

4. **Initialize**: Run the initialization command to set up your user data and repository configuration:

    ```shell
    python main.py -c init
    ```

    Follow the prompts to provide your GitHub username, repository name, and access token.

## 3. Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Secpar has two primary modes of operation: initialization and scraping.

### Initialization <a name="initialization"></a>

Initialization is the first step to configure your scraper for a GitHub repository.

1. Run the initialization command:

    ```shell
    python main.py -c init
    ```

2. Follow the prompts to enter your GitHub username, repository name, and access token.

### Scraping <a name="scraping"></a>

Scraping allows you to retrieve code submissions from supported platforms and store them in your GitHub repository.

1. To scrape submissions, use the following command:

    ```shell
    python main.py -s PLATFORM_NAME
    ```

    Replace `PLATFORM_NAME` with one of the supported platforms: `codeforces`, `cses`, or `vjudge`.

2. Depending on the platform, you may need to provide additional information such as your platform username and password.

3. Secpar will fetch new submissions and update your GitHub repository.

## 4. Command-Line Interface <a name="command-line-interface"></a>

Secpar provides a command-line interface with the following options:

- `-c`, `--command`: Specify the command (`init` for initialization or `update` for scraping).

- `-s`, `--scrap`: Specify the platform to scrape data from (`codeforces`, `cses`, or `vjudge`).

- `--help`: Display usage instructions and available options.

Example usage:

```shell
python main.py -c init
python main.py -s codeforces
```

## 5. Scraper Configuration <a name="scraper-configuration"></a>

Secpar can be configured in several ways:

- **GitHub Configuration**: Set up your GitHub repository details and access token during initialization.

- **Platform Authentication**: Authenticate with your platform credentials (e.g., Codeforces username and password) for scraping.

- **Customization**: Customize the formatting of your README and configure scraper options in the code (e.g., maximum requests, submission per update).

## 6. Customization <a name="customization"></a>

You can customize Secpar's behavior by modifying the source code. Here are some customization options:

- **Formatting**: Customize the formatting of the generated README for each platform. You can modify the formatting in the corresponding `Formatter` class.

- **Configuration**: Adjust Secpar's settings, such as maximum requests, submissions per update, or other platform-specific parameters.

## 7. Data Storage <a name="data-storage"></a>

Secpar stores code submissions and related information in your GitHub repository. Each submission is listed in the README with details such as problem name, language, solution link, tags, and submission date.

## 8. FAQs <a name="faqs"></a>

- **What platforms does Secpar support?**
  - Secpar currently supports Codeforces, CSES (University of Helsinki), and Vjudge.

- **Is it safe to store my GitHub access token?**
