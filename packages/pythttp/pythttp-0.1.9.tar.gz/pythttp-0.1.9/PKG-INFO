This project is aimed at gaining an understanding of the communication methods and interactions between clients and servers within the HTTP protocol,
which is one of the commonly used communication protocols. The project has been implemented using Python, 
and its primary goal is to provide a basic HTTP protocol implementation.  Going forward,
there are plans to add additional features and continue to enhance its capabilities.

At present, the project is capable of handling both GET and POST requests. However,
 there are plans to further develop the project to include more advanced functionalities.
