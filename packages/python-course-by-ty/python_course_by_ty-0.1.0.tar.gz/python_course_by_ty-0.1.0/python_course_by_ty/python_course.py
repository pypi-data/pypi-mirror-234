#The purpose of this file is to assess the answers by students taking Ty's Python course
#Students should install this code either via pip or directly placing the file in the folder they will be coding in
#The notebooks provided to the students will then import this file and make calls to it
#Each function corresponds to a quiz question in a quiz that is associated with the notebook they are working through
#If the student's answer is correct, the function will output a keyword or phrase to answer the quiz question with
#If the answer is incorrect, the function will output a statement telling them their answer was incorrect
#Risks associated with beginner python students finding answers in this file was felt to be minimal and worth alternatives
