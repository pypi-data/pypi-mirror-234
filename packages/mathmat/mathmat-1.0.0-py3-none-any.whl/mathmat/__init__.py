"""MathMat is a matrix library built on NumPy that tries to reuse
existing data from past computations whenever possible.

The functionality is built around the Matrix class, which represents
a matrix as an array of data plus a dictionary of properties. As
properties are checked and/or computed, existing information is reused
when possible to speed up new computations.

MathMat also provides utilities for performing matrix factorizations
via the `factor` submodule, solving linear systems via the `solve`
submodule, and visualizations using the `plot` submodule.
