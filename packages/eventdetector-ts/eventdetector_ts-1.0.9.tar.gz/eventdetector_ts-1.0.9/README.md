## Introduction
We present a new `Universal` deep-learning supervised method for detecting events in
multivariate time series data. This method combines `4` distinct
novelties compared to existing deep-learning supervised methods.
Firstly, it is based on `regression` instead of binary classification.
Secondly, it `does not require labeled datasets` where each point is
labeled; instead, it only requires reference events defined as time
points or intervals of time. Thirdly, it is designed to be `robust`
through the use of a stacked ensemble learning metamodel that
combines deep learning models, from classic feed-forward
neural networks (FFNs) to the state-of-the-art architectures like
transformers. By leveraging the collective strengths of multiple
models, this ensemble approach can mitigate individual model
weaknesses and biases, resulting in more robust predictions.
Finally, to facilitate practical implementation, we have developed
a Python package called `EventDetector` to accompany the proposed method. 
It provides a rich support for event detection in time series.

## Quickstart Examples
### Data sets
To quickly get started with `EventDetector`, follow the steps below:

- You can either download the datasets and event catalogs manually or use the built-in methods for the desired application:
  - Martian Bow Shock: `eventdetector_ts.load_martian_bow_shock()`
      - [bow_shock_dataset](https://archive.org/download/martian_bow_shock_dataset/martian_bow_shock_dataset.pkl)
      - [bow_shock_events](https://archive.org/download/martian_bow_shock_events/martian_bow_shock_events.csv)
  - Credit Card Fraud: `eventdetector_ts.load_credit_card_fraud()`
      - [credit_card_dataset](https://archive.org/download/credit_card_fraud_dataset/credit_card_fraud_dataset.csv)
      - [credit_card_events](https://archive.org/download/credit_card_fraud_events/credit_card_fraud_events.csv)
### Code Implementations:
  - Credit Card Fraud:
```python
from eventdetector_ts import load_credit_card_fraud
from eventdetector_ts.metamodel.meta_model import MetaModel

dataset, events = load_credit_card_fraud()

meta_model = MetaModel(dataset=dataset, events=events, width=3, step=1, output_dir='credit_card_fraud', batch_size=3000)

# Prepare the events and dataset for computing op.
meta_model.prepare_data_and_computing_op()
# Builds a stacking learning pipeline using the provided models and hyperparameters.
meta_model.build_stacking_learning()
# Run the Event Extraction Optimization process.
meta_model.event_extraction_optimization()
# Plot the results: Losses, true/predicted op, true/predicted events, deltat_t.
meta_model.plot_save(show_plots=True)
```
Or just call `fit` method :
```python
from eventdetector_ts import load_credit_card_fraud
from eventdetector_ts.metamodel.meta_model import MetaModel

dataset, events = load_credit_card_fraud()

meta_model = MetaModel(dataset=dataset, events=events, width=3, step=1, output_dir='credit_card_fraud', batch_size=3000)

meta_model.fit()
```
  - Martian Bow Shock:
```python
from eventdetector_ts import load_martian_bow_shock
from eventdetector_ts.metamodel.meta_model import MetaModel

dataset, events = load_martian_bow_shock()

meta_model = MetaModel(output_dir="mex_bow_shocks", dataset=dataset, events=events, width=45, step=1,
                       time_window=5400.0, batch_size=3000)

meta_model.fit()

```
### Results and Performance Evaluation

#### Performance Metrics

Table below presents the performance metrics for precision, recall, and F1-Score, providing a quantitative assessment of the framework's accuracy and effectiveness in the two data sets.

| Data set          | F1-Score | Precision | Recall   |
|-------------------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Martian bow shock | 0.9021   | 0.9455    | 0.8626   |
| Credit card fraud | 0.8372   | 0.9643    | 0.7397   |

#### Training and Validation Losses

The Figure below showcases the training loss and validation loss of the stacked models during the training process on the Martian bow shock and credit card fraud cases. The stacked models used in this evaluation consist of two feedforward neural networks (`FFN_0`, `FFN_1`) with distinct configurations of hyperparameters. The low losses observed in both cases indicate that the meta model has successfully learned the underlying patterns, justifying the obtained good metrics.

## Make Prediction
```python
from eventdetector_ts.prediction.prediction import predict
from eventdetector_ts.prediction.utils import plot_prediction

dataset_for_prediction = ...

# Call the 'predict' method
predicted_events, predicted_op, filtered_predicted_op = predict(dataset=dataset_for_prediction,
                                                                path='path to output_dir')
# Plot the predictions
plot_prediction(predicted_op=predicted_op, filtered_predicted_op=filtered_predicted_op)
```

| `time_window`               | Union[int, float]                   | This parameter controls the amount of data within the dataset is used for the training process. If it's an integer, it represents a specific number time steps.  If it's a float, it represents a duration in seconds. By default, it is set to None, which means all available data will be used. However, if a value is provided, the dataset will include a specific interval of data surrounding each reference event. This interval includes data from both sides of each event, with a duration equal to the specified `time_window`. Setting a `time_window` in some situations can offer several advantages, such as accelerating the training process and enhancing the neural networks' understanding of rare events. | None                                   |

#### Prepare data for computing the overlapping parameter `op`
The second thing to do is to prepare the events and the dataset for computing `op`:
```python
meta_model.prepare_data_and_computing_op()
```

#### Stacking Ensemble Learning Pipeline
The third thing to do is to build a stacking learning pipeline using the provided models and hyperparameters:

```python
meta_model.build_stacking_learning()
```

#### Event Extraction Optimization
The fourth thing to do is to run the Event Extraction Optimization process:

```python
meta_model.event_extraction_optimization()
```

#### Get The Results and Plots
Finally, you can plot the results, which are saved automatically: losses, true/predicted ops, true/predicted events, and delta_t.

```python
meta_model.plot_save(show_plots=True)
```
