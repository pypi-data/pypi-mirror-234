        the delta latitude or longitude between your two points does not
        exceed 4 decimal degrees.

        The standard formula (Haversine) is the exact one (that is, it works
        for any couple of longitude/latitude on earth) but is much slower as
        it needs 7 trigonometric and 2 square roots.  If your couple of points
        are not too far apart, and absolute precision is not paramount, you
        can use this approximate version (Equirectangular), which is much
        faster as it uses only one trigonometric and one square root:
