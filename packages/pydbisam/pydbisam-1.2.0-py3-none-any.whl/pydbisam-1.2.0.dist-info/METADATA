PyDBISAM
========

PyDBISAM is a pure Python module to read and export data from DBISAM tables (from their `.dat` files). The scope of PyDBISAM is _not_ to provide a full database framework but merely to provide the ability to read the table structure and the raw table data.

DBISAM is an on-disk database with one file per table. The file format is proprietary. The basic structure is [documented here](NOTES.md).


CLI Usage
---------
PyDBISAM includes a simple CLI that can be used to dump the table structure or export the data to various formats (e.g.: CSV).

```shell
# pydbisam --dump-structure path/to/file.dat

# pydbisam --dump-csv path/to/file.dat
```


Code Usage
----------
The PyDBISAM class can be used for read-only access to the tables.
```python
from pydbisam import PyDBISAM

with PyDBISAM("path/to/file.dat") as db:
	print(", ".join(db.fields()))
	for row in db.rows():
		print(", ".join(map(str, row)))
```
