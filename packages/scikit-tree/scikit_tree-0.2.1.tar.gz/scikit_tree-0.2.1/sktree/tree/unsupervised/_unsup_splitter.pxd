cdef class UnsupervisedSplitter(BaseSplitter):
    """
    Notable changes wrt scikit-learn:
    1. `weighted_n_node_samples` is used as a stopping criterion and just used to
    keep count of the "number of samples (weighted)". All samples have a default weight
    of '1'.
    2. `X` array instead of `y` array is stored as the criterions are computed over the X
    array.
    3. The feature_values memoryview is a feature vector with shared memory among the splitter
    and the criterion object. This enables the splitter to assign values to it within the
    `node_split` function and then `criterion` automatically can compute relevant statistics
    on the shared memoryview into the array.
