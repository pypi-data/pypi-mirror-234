 *  @file SnapPea.h
 *
 *  @brief The public interface to the SnapPea kernel.
 *
 *  This file defines the interface between SnapPea's computational kernel
 *  ("the kernel") and the user-interface ("the UI").  Both parts
 *  must \#include this file, and anything shared between the two parts
 *  must be declared in this file.  The only communication between the
 *  two parts is via function calls -- no external variables are shared.
 *
 *  All external symbols in the UI must begin with 'u' followed by a
 *  capital letter.  Nothing in the kernel should begin in this way.
 *
 *  Typedef names use capitals for the first letter of each word,
 *  e.g. Triangulation, CuspIndex.
 *
 *  SnapPea 2.0 was funded by the University of Minnesota's
 *  Geometry Center and the U.S. National Science Foundation.
 *  SnapPea 3.0 is funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation
 *  and the MacArthur Foundation.  SnapPea and its source code may
 *  be used freely for all noncommercial purposes.  Please direct
 *  questions, problems and suggestions to Jeff Weeks (weeks@northnet.org).

 *  The kernel uses the three functions uLongComputationBegins(),

 *  the UI of a long computation.  The UI relays this information to
 *  the user in whatever manner it considers appropriate.  For
 *  example, it might wait a second or two after the beginning of a
 *  long computation, and then display a dialog box containing
 *  *message (a typical message might be "finding canonical
 *  triangulation" or "computing hyperbolic structure").  If
 *  is_abortable is TRUE, the dialog box would contain an abort
 *  button.  The reason for waiting a second or two before displaying
 *  the dialog box is to avoid annoying the user with flashing dialog
 *  boxes for computations which turn out not to be so long after all.
 *
 *  The kernel is responsible for calling uLongComputationContinues() at
 *  least every 1/60 second or so during a long computation.
 *  uLongComputationContinues() serves two purposes:
 *
 *  (1) It lets the UI yield time to its window system.  (This is
 *      crucial for smooth background operation in the Mac's
 *      cooperative multitasking environment.  I don't know whether
 *      it is necessary in X or NeXT.)
 *
 *  (2) If the computation is abortable, it checks whether the user
 *      has asked to abort, and returns the result (func_cancelled
 *      to abort, func_OK to continue).
 *
 *  While the kernel is responsible for making sure uLongComputationContinues()
 *  is called often enough, uLongComputationContinues() itself must take
 *  responsibility for not repeating time-consuming operations too often.
 *  For example, it might return immediately from a call if less than
 *  1/60 of a second has elapsed since the last time it carried out
 *  its full duties.
 *
 *  uLongComputationEnds() signals that the long computation is over.
 *  The kernel must call uLongComputationEnds() even after an aborted
 *  computation.  ( uLongComputationContinues() merely informs the kernel
 *  that the user punched the abort button.  The kernel must still call
 *  uLongComputationEnds() to dismiss the dialog box in the usual way.)
 *
 *  If the UI receives a call to uLongComputationEnds() when no long
 *  computation is in progress, or a call to uLongComputationBegins()
 *  when a long computation is already in progress, it should notify
 *  the user of the error and exit.
 *
 *  If the UI receives a call to uLongComputationContinues() when in
 *  fact no long computation is in progress, it should simply take
 *  care of any background responsibilities (see (1) above) and not
 *  complain.  The reason for this provision is that the calls to
 *  uLongComputationBegins() and uLongComputationEnds() occur in high
 *  level functions, while the calls to uLongComputationContinues()
 *  occur at the lowest level, perhaps in a different file.  Someday
 *  those low-level functions (for example, the routines for solving
 *  simultaneous linear equations) might be called as part of some quick,
 *  non-abortable computation.
