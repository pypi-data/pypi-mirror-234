"""
    This module demonstrates how to use Dragonfly to create a voice command
    for opening any currently active Windows drive in a new explorer window.

    This module constrains the list of drive letters to active ones through
    use of Dragonfly's dynamic lists.  Dynamic lists allow the user to
    change parts of spoken commands without having to reload the grammar.
