"""
Text action
============================================================================

This section describes the :class:`Text` action object.  This type of action
is used for typing text into the foreground window.

To use this action on X11 (Linux), the
`xdotool <https://www.semicomplete.com/projects/xdotool/>`__ program must be
installed and the ``DISPLAY`` environment variable set.

The :class:`Text` action differs from :class:`Key` in that it is used for
typing literal text, while :class:`Key` emulates pressing keys on the
keyboard.  An example of this is that the arrow-keys are not part of a text
and so cannot be typed using the :class:`Text` action, but can be sent by
the :class:`Key` action.


Unicode Character Keystrokes (Text)
............................................................................

The :class:`Text` action may be used on Windows and X11 (Linux) to type most
Unicode characters (code points).  This feature is not available on macOS.

Please see :ref:`RefUnicodeCharacterKeystrokesKey` for documentation on this
subject.  Most of it applies to :class:`Text` action objects too.


Using Natlink for keyboard input on Windows (Text)
............................................................................

On Windows, the :class:`Key` action object may be configured to send events
via Natlink.  This allows one to make use of Dragon NaturallySpeaking's
ability to control applications running in elevated mode, i.e.,
administrative applications.

Please see :ref:`RefNatlinkKeyboardInput` for documentation on this subject.
