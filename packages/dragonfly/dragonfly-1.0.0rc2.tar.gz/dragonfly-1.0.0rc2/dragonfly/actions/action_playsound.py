"""
PlaySound action
============================================================================

This section describes the :class:`PlaySound` action object.  This
type of action is used to play system sounds or wave files.


Example PlaySound uses
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following example shows how to play a wave file using an
:class:`PlaySound` action object::

    PlaySound(file=r"C:\\Windows\\media\\tada.wav").execute()


PlaySound on Windows
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The behavior of the :class:`PlaySound` action object differs between
platforms.  On Windows, it may be used to play Windows system sounds.
This is achieved via the *name* parameter.  For example::

    # Play the logon sound.
    PlaySound("WindowsLogon").execute()

    # Play the system shutdown sound.
    PlaySound("SystemExit").execute()

For this to work, the specified name must be listed (without spaces)
in the Windows *Sound* control panel window, in the *Sounds* tab.
If an invalid file path, or an unknown system sound, is specified,
the default error sound will be played.


PlaySound on macOS and Linux
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

On macOS and Linux, the :class:`PlaySound` action object uses the
`sounddevice <https://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.io/>`__ package
to play specified wave files.  This package may be installed by
running the following command: ::

    $ pip install 'dragonfly[playsound]'

The *name* parameter is an alias for *file* on these platforms.

On these platforms, an error message will be shown if an invalid file
path is specified.
