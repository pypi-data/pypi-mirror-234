        Get the engine implementation.

        This function will initialize an engine instance using the
        ``get_engine`` and ``is_engine_available`` functions in the engine
        packages and return an instance of the first available engine.  If
        one has already been initialized, it will be returned instead.

        If no specific engine is requested and no engine has already been
        initialized, this function will initialize and return an instance of
        the first available engine in the following order:

         =======================   =========================================
         SR engine back-end        Engine name string(s)
         =======================   =========================================
         1. Dragon/Natlink         ``"natlink"``
         2. Kaldi                  ``"kaldi"``
         3. WSR/SAPI 5             ``"sapi5", "sapi5inproc", "sapi5shared"``
         4. CMU Pocket Sphinx      ``"sphinx"``
         =======================   =========================================

        The :ref:`Text-input engine <RefTextEngine>` can be initialized by
        specifying ``"text"`` as the engine name.  This back-end will
        **not** be initialized if no specific engine is requested because
        the back-end is not a real SR engine and is used mostly for testing.
