    Check for X11 by looking at the value of the *DISPLAY* environment
    variable.

    two forms below, this function returns true.  Otherwise, it returns
    false.

    Acceptable forms of the *DISPLAY* variable:

        * [hostname]:displaynumber[.screennumber]

    segments, no attempt is made to validate them.  The *displaynumber* and
    segments, however, must be a digit string, as does the *screennumber*,
    if it is present.
