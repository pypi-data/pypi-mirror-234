## Usage

### Initial setup

1. cd to your desired install directory and use [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) to install the package.

   
    ```
    pip install biopytk
    ```
    ***OR***
2. Navigate to the [PyPi BioPyTK download page](https://pypi.org/project/biopytk/#files) and install manually.

## FAQ

#### Can I use this package for my own work?
Absolutely! Please see the [License](#License) information below.
#### Will this package work with older versions of Python?
It is recommended to use ``>Python 3.11.1`` as this was the version the package was built on. If future Python releases cause dependency issues, patches will be released.
#### Why are you making this if [BioPython](https://biopython.org/) exists?
This is a personal project to practice bioinformatics tooling creation, package management, and overall explore bioinformatics. This is in no way intended to take over large open-source projects, but rather act as a sandbox for personal research and development!
