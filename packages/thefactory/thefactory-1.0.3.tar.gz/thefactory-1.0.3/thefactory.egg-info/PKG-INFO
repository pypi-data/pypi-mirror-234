Description: <h1>TheFactory</h1>
        This is the thefactory module. It contains factory config and google config files.
        
        Install the module via going to this directory and
        
        pip install thefactory
        
        Actually what we're currently doing is:
        rsync -avx /opt/development/thefactory_module/thefactory /opt/thefactory_venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/ --delete
        
        Call it via
        
        from thefactory import config 
        or
        import thefactory.config as config
        from thefactory import google_configv4
        or
        import thefactory.google_configv4 as gconf
        
        Wonder of wonders.
        
        Spark up the venv
        source /opt/thefactory_venv/bin/activate
        Navigate to thefactory_module directory
        pip install .
        
        ### BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE
        
        pip install --editable .
        
        symlinks the code to the place, so you NEVER have to install the changes again.  Just restart the python process.
