        This function checks data quality by plotting raw baseline pupil sizes,

        and after outlier trials exclusion.

    arguments:
        data:
            desc: Indicates to-be-analyzed dataset

        z_threshold:

        downsample:
            desc:   The value according to which data is downsampled. 
            Used to convert x-axis of plots to original units. Default is 10.

        xlabel_trace:
            desc:   The label of the x-axis of the trace plot (left panel).
