Uptrend Channel Breakout

Friday, August 5th, 2011 at 10:16 am
Leave your comment

The Yen complex has finally joined in the fun that the JPYAUD has been spreading across the globe. Another flight to safety is helping trigger the breakout that has been in the pipeline for about a week now.

The AUDJPY may become extended on the upside. I would be cautious with any long signals here.

Continue reading for a detailed rundown on the charts and analysis of interest.

Aussie Dollar

The double bottom is completed here at 0.8533. This triggered a pullback to the broken neckline at 0.8886. After a somewhat extended retracement, where the first double bottom eventually broke, market has pushed the Aussie back to resistance at 0.9071. A bullish divergence is forming, which is a hopefully sign for the bulls (pink link below the chart).

Oscillator

The stochastics might break down in the near future, but considering prolonged bullish divergence, taking at least partial profits on the first run higher is recommended.

Link Finally! Crude’s Bullish Divergence has Triggered., Apr 3rd, 2011

AUDNZD

An Uptrend Channel breakout here (solid black line) with a bullish divergence is a very strong signal. The blue rectangular box represents last week’s price action. After crossing the neckline at 1.2706 market ran into the trend line. Given the bullish momentum and potential carried by the momentum divergence, I would not expect an extended period of sideways to down price action.

Continue finding out what bands and which market action informs us about the Aussie.

- "If you could choose any language to study (or know) what would it be?" 

without the rest in the context, also including your own questions (starting an ongoing dialog is ideal) : ___________

I also gathered that the Milhouse towel was a coincidence in this clip. Her towel fell once near them, but it covered most of her face so it was hardly visible.. the second incident (right after) they were not ready, and did not move (this shows it was not a coincidence). On top of that, all other shows on tuesday are script show rehearsals and then the show is taped, and every shows, quoted above, have been recorded in the past few weeks, except Meet the Press, right at end of closed door process, which makes the extension for George potentially more convincing. 

_________________________________________

Here comes my theory. I've had those ones :
 In a parallel universe, the George Bush who won his bid in the 70's wins Iraq war (event happening once again, this time breaking USSR). About the 100th, `<insert two letter country number>` and then a final after "it's a free humanities university for undergraduates working toward their starter degree."


 As you have to know, it is possible that tapes disappeared during the wars that ensued after his statement above, in which countries and humans themselves would be free of pressure from totalitarian regime, the Big war. If the tapes didn't disappear, the podcasts are kept aside in case of world unendable wars, to give peace to mankind's soul (sample list below). If George actually chooses to accept Milhouse's Grandma sending Sokka, not compromising his threat of war,   ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

2023-10-06 12:30:04 - cli_companion <RESPONSE> " kind of poems that other people might think were silly. If I had never fallen in love with language and words, this would have been Nothing. From other people's perspective, this might be nothing. All in all, Hades & Persephone is Nothing, and nothing makes it what it is today. But this Nothing had an integral part in my story as a writer: They made my best friends, they made me tear up, cry, and laugh, they stirred me to my tired bones and gave my sluggish heart its wakeup call.

There's so much more to say, but I'll just say this: Nothing, such as something as Nothing, can give you a sense of pride. I'm proud of my poetry as I'm proud of everything that I do and have done, and that includes the Nothing. Not all of the poems were good. Not all of them were mediocre. In fact, I think only one or two of them were explicitly good/new and novel, because at that time, I was filled with adrenaline and hatred and hope and hurt and longing. But for the rest of my poems, I pledge you this:

No poem was born with a mind of its own.

I stewed over them, I drafted them, I worked, and I rewrote them into being.

A poet knows the wrath of a blank page.

Whoever you take as your masters, honing your craft, whatever you do to hit your aims, keep on churning the molten lava in your mind into something that shows you knocked and ate your Nikes because you didn't know the truth.

Twas Ethan Dilio

For Mike Ramos' term in the 84th Associate Justice of the Supreme Court

Did the founding fathers know what they laid out for us?

Did they know what the story of the constitution, The Bill of Rights, would shape up to be?

'Twas Ethan Dilio

They had just wrestled freedom from the devil's claw

Illumined the bails, and shackled any monarch's punishing haughtiness

Illumined the thumbtacks, and shook any zit-head's petty masculinity

Divine creator, define justice, King We, I, and Thou, Thou shall and thou shalt not

Thou shall die in a hangman's noose or hung 'til dead

Thou shalt not know thine ANYTHING

Verdict: Outrageous! Contemptuous! The Reds are Falling!

Verdict: Yaw! Shrug! We found a better alternative!

Verdict: Prison! Death! For all his lying to the press.

-------------------

Summary: "Guimothy Pri" stands for "Kei Lam of Deputy Prosecutor Kathy Keim. Kei Lam of the Joe Public" or something like that. And because it mentions just Kathy Keim, giving someone less credit than another individual works for extreme sarcastic purposes, especially if you're writing an irate, angry poem with a lot of blank spaces that only make sense to people who are part of a group and let out their fury only in obscene words.

Concept: The main character is Kathy Keim. She is a public defender. She's trying to save her client, Kei Lam, from the wrath of the law, who has sued Kathy Keim for botching a PO license.

Ever so many skip days, the public defender misses hearings of her (client) client, Kei Lam. The judge gets mad, and she accuses Kathy of being incompetent.
