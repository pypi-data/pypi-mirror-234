# Streamlit app

We created a visualistion in Streamlit in order for others to explore the dataset.

The first step in creating this visualisation is preparing the data for it. This is done by running:

```
python ojd_daps_skills/analysis/OJO/process_viz_data.py
```

[This requires the data saved by running `python ojd_daps_skills/analysis/ojo/get_skill_occurrences_matrix.py`]

This app is run from the [ojd-daps-skills-analysis](https://github.com/nestauk/ojd-daps-skills-analysis) repo.
