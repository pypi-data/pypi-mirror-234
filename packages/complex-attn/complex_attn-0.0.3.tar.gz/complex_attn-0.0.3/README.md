# Complex Transformer
The open source implementation of the attention and transformer from "Building Blocks for a Complex-Valued Transformer Architecture" where they propose an an attention mechanism for complex valued signals or images such as MRI and remote sensing.

They present:
- complex valued scaled dot product attention
- complex valued layer normalization
- results show improved robustness to overfitting while maintaing performance wbhen compared to real valued transformer
