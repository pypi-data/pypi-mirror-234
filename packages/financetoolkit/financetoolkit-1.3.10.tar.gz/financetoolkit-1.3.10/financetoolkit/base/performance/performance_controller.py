        Calculate the Beta, a measurement that assess the systematic risk of a stock or investment.

        Beta is a financial metric used to assess the systematic risk of a stock or investment in
        relation to the overall market. It provides valuable insights into how a particular asset's
        returns tend to move in response to fluctuations in the broader market. A stock's Beta is
        calculated by analyzing its historical price movements and their correlation with the
        movements of a market index, typically the benchmark index like the S&P 500.

        The formula is as follows:

            - Beta = Covariance of Asset Returns and Benchmark Returns / Variance of Benchmark Returns

        For a given period, for example monthly, this translates into the following:

            - Beta = Monthly Covariance of Asset Returns and Benchmark Returns
            / Monthly Variance of Benchmark Returns

            results in basing it off the quarterly parameter as defined in the class instance.
            rolling (int, optional): The rolling period to use for the calculation. If you select
            period = 'monthly' and set rolling to 12 you obtain the rolling 12-month Sharpe Ratio.
            rounding (int, optional): The number of decimals to round the results to. Defaults to 4.
            growth (bool, optional): Whether to calculate the growth of the ratios. Defaults to False.

        Returns:

        Notes:
        - Daily Beta is not an option as the standard deviation for 1 day is close to zero. Therefore, it does
        not give any useful insights.
        - The method retrieves historical data and calculates the Beta for each asset in the Toolkit instance.
        - The risk-free rate is often represented by the return of a risk-free investment, such as a Treasury bond.

        CAPM, or the Capital Asset Pricing Model, is a financial model used to estimate the expected return
        on an investment, such as a stock or portfolio of stocks. It provides a framework for evaluating the
        risk and return trade-off of an asset or portfolio in relation to the overall market. CAPM is based
        on the following key components:

            - Risk-Free Rate (Rf): This is the theoretical return an investor could earn from an investment
            with no risk of financial loss. It is typically based on the yield of a government bond.
            - Market Risk Premium (Rm - Rf): This represents the additional return that investors expect
            to earn for taking on the risk of investing in the overall market as opposed to a risk-free asset.
            It is calculated as the difference between the expected return of the market (Rm) and the risk-free
            rate (Rf).
            - Beta (β): Beta is a measure of an asset's or portfolio's sensitivity to market movements. It
            quantifies how much an asset's returns are expected to move in relation to changes in the
            overall market. A beta of 1 indicates that the asset moves in line with the market, while a
            beta greater than 1 suggests higher volatility, and a beta less than 1 indicates lower volatility.

        The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a widely used financial model that helps in
        determining the expected return of an asset or portfolio based on its systematic risk and
        the prevailing risk-free rate in the market. CAPM provides insights into how an asset or
        investment should be priced in order to offer an appropriate rate of return, given its
        level of risk compared to the overall market.

        The formula is as follows:

            Capital Asset Pricing Model = Risk Free Rate + Beta * (Benchmark Returns - Risk Free Rate)

        See definition: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_asset_pricing_model

        Args:
            period (str, optional): The period to use for the calculation. Defaults to None which

            show_full_results (bool, optional): Whether to show the full results. Defaults to False.
            rounding (int, optional): The number of decimals to round the results to. Defaults to 4.
            growth (bool, optional): Whether to calculate the growth of the ratios. Defaults to False.

        Calculate the Sharpe ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted return that evaluates the excess return
        of an investment portfolio or asset per unit of risk taken.

        The Sharpe ratio is calculated as the difference between the expected return of the asset or portfolio
        and the risk-free rate of return, divided by the standard deviation of the asset or portfolio's excess return.
        It quantifies the amount of return generated for each unit of risk assumed, providing insights into the
        investment's performance relative to the risk taken.

        The formula is as follows:

            - Sharpe Ratio = Excess Return / Excess Standard Deviation

        For a given period, for example monthly, this translates into the following:

            - Sharpe Ratio = Average Monthly Excess Return / Standard Deviation of Monthly Excess Returns

        For a rolling period, this translates into the following:

            - Sharpe Ratio = Average Rolling Excess Return / Standard Deviation of Rolling Excess Returns

        Note that this is explicitly already subtracts the Risk Free Rate.

        The Information Ratio (IR), also known as the Information Coefficient, is a financial
        metric that assesses the risk-adjusted performance of a portfolio or investment
        strategy relative to a benchmark index. It quantifies how much excess return the
        portfolio generates for each unit of tracking error (volatility of tracking error).
        The Information Ratio is commonly used by portfolio managers, financial analysts, and
        investors to evaluate the skill of a portfolio manager in generating returns beyond
        what would be expected based on the risk taken.

        - IR > 0: A positive Information Ratio indicates that the portfolio has generated
        excess returns compared to the benchmark, suggesting that the portfolio manager has added value.
        - IR = 0: An Information Ratio of zero implies that the portfolio's excess return
        is in line with the benchmark, meaning the portfolio manager has not added or lost value relative
        to the benchmark.
        - IR < 0: A negative Information Ratio suggests that the portfolio has underperformed
        the benchmark, potentially indicating that the portfolio manager has detracted value.

        The formula is as follows:

            - Information Ratio (IR) = (Portfolio's Excess Return - Benchmark's Excess Return) / Tracking Error

        See definition: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_ratio

        Args:
            period (str, optional): The period to use for the calculation. Defaults to None which
            results in basing it off the quarterly parameter as defined in the class instance.
            rounding (int, optional): The number of decimals to round the results to. Defaults to 4.
            growth (bool, optional): Whether to calculate the growth of the ratios. Defaults to False.
            lag (int | str, optional): The lag to use for the growth calculation. Defaults to 1.

        Returns:
            pd.DataFrame: Information ratio values.

        Notes:
        - Daily Information Ratio is not an option as the standard deviation for 1 day is close to zero.
        Therefore, it does not give any useful insights.
        - The method retrieves historical data and calculates the IR for each asset in the Toolkit instance.
        - The risk-free rate is often represented by the return of a risk-free investment, such as a Treasury bond.
        - If `growth` is set to True, the method calculates the growth of the ratio values using the specified `lag`.

        As an example:

        ```python
        from financetoolkit import Toolkit

        toolkit = Toolkit(["AAPL", "TSLA"], api_key=FMP_KEY)

        toolkit.performance.get_information_ratio()
