Nifigator
=========

Nifigator is a pure Python package for working with NLP in RDF. It uses the `NLP Interchange Format (NIF) <https://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core/nif-core.html>`_ and the `Lexicon Model for Ontologies <https://www.lemon-model.net/>`_ and is build on top of `RDFLib <https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib>`_.

Here is what is does:

* Convert data from text documents to NIF data in RDF

  - Currently supported formats: txt, PDF (text, page and paragraph offsets)

* Add linguistic annotations from NLP processors

  - Currently supported processor: `Stanza <https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/>`_

* Create NifVector graphs that work like language models, this allow you to
  
  - create explainable word vectors without random results, and to

  - combine word vectors with lexical and linguistic annotations

* RDFLib is used to serialize and deserialize NIF data.

See the `documentation <https://nifigator.readthedocs.io>`_ built from the code.
