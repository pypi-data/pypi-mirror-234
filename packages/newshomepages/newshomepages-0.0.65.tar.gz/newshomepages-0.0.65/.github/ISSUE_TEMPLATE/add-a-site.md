The process for adding a site is spelled out in [our documentation](https://palewi.re/docs/news-homepages/adding.html). Users who aren't comfortable suggesting the change via a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) can submit a request here.

You should fill in the following information about the site:

| Field               | Value       |
|--------------------|--------------|
| Twitter handle |                |
| Url                   |                |
| Name              |                |
| Location          |                |
| Timezone        |                |

A list of timezones can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/heyalexej/8bf688fd67d7199be4a1682b3eec7568).
