‚¶ø `Motivation`: Due to all kinds of reasons like failure of collection sensors, communication error,
and unexpected malfunction, missing values are common to see in time series from the real-world environment.
This makes partially-observed time series (POTS) a pervasive problem in open-world modeling and prevents advanced
data analysis. Although this problem is important, the area of data mining on POTS still lacks a dedicated toolkit.
PyPOTS is created to fill in this blank.

‚¶ø `Mission`: PyPOTS (pronounced "Pie Pots") is born to become a handy toolbox that is going to make data mining on POTS easy rather than
tedious, to help engineers and researchers focus more on the core problems in their hands rather than on how to deal
with the missing parts in their data. PyPOTS will keep integrating classical and the latest state-of-the-art data mining
algorithms for partially-observed multivariate time series. For sure, besides various algorithms, PyPOTS is going to
have unified APIs together with detailed documentation and interactive examples across algorithms as tutorials.

ü§ó **Please** star this repo to help others notice PyPOTS if you think it is a useful toolkit.
**Please** properly [cite PyPOTS](https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyPOTS#-citing-pypots) in your publications
if it helps with your research. This really means a lot to our open-source research. Thank you!

To make various open-source time-series datasets readily available to our users,
PyPOTS gets supported by its subproject [TSDB (Time-Series Data Base)](https://github.com/WenjieDu/TSDB),
a toolbox making loading time-series datasets super easy!

Visit [TSDB](https://github.com/WenjieDu/TSDB) right now to know more about this handy tool üõ†!
It now supports a total of 168 open-source datasets.

## ‚ùñ Installation
You can refer to [the installation instruction](https://docs.pypots.com/en/latest/install.html) in PyPOTS documentation for a guideline with more details.

PyPOTS is available on both [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypots) and [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pypots).
You can install PyPOTS as shown below:

``` bash
# by pip
pip install pypots            # the first time installation
pip install pypots --upgrade  # update pypots to the latest version

# by conda
conda install -c conda-forge pypots  # the first time installation
conda update  -c conda-forge pypots  # update pypots to the latest version
````

Alternatively, you can install from the latest source code with the latest features but may be not officially released yet:
> pip install https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyPOTS/archive/main.zip

PyPOTS tutorials have been released. Considering the future workload, I separate the tutorials into a single repo,
and you can find them in [BrewPOTS](https://github.com/WenjieDu/BrewPOTS).
Take a look at it now, and learn how to brew your POTS datasets!

You can also find a simple and quick-start tutorial notebook on Google Colab with
[this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HEFjylEy05-r47jRy0H9jiS_WhD0UWmQ?usp=sharing).
If you have further questions, please refer to PyPOTS documentation [docs.pypots.com](https://docs.pypots.com).
Besides, you can also [raise an issue](https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyPOTS/issues) or [ask in our community](#-community).

We present you a usage example of imputing missing values in time series with PyPOTS below, you can click it to view.

<details>
<summary><b>Click here to see an example applying SAITS on PhysioNet2012 for imputation:</b></summary>

``` python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from pypots.data import load_specific_dataset, mcar, masked_fill
from pypots.imputation import SAITS
from pypots.utils.metrics import cal_mae
# Data preprocessing. Tedious, but PyPOTS can help.
data = load_specific_dataset('physionet_2012')  # PyPOTS will automatically download and extract it.
X = data['X']
num_samples = len(X['RecordID'].unique())
X = X.drop(['RecordID', 'Time'], axis = 1)
X = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X.to_numpy())
X = X.reshape(num_samples, 48, -1)
X_intact, X, missing_mask, indicating_mask = mcar(X, 0.1) # hold out 10% observed values as ground truth
X = masked_fill(X, 1 - missing_mask, np.nan)
dataset = {"X": X}
print(dataset["X"].shape)  # (11988, 48, 37), 11988 samples, 48 time steps, 37 features
# Model training. This is PyPOTS showtime.
saits = SAITS(n_steps=48, n_features=37, n_layers=2, d_model=256, d_inner=128, n_heads=4, d_k=64, d_v=64, dropout=0.1, epochs=10)
saits.fit(dataset)  # train the model. Here I use the whole dataset as the training set, because ground truth is not visible to the model.
imputation = saits.impute(dataset)  # impute the originally-missing values and artificially-missing values
mae = cal_mae(imputation, X_intact, indicating_mask)  # calculate mean absolute error on the ground truth (artificially-missing values)
```

## ‚ùñ Available Algorithms
PyPOTS supports imputation, classification, clustering, and forecasting tasks on multivariate time series with missing values. The currently available algorithms of four tasks are cataloged in the following table with four partitions. The paper references are all listed at the bottom of this readme file. Please refer to them if you want more details.

## ‚ùñ Citing PyPOTS
**[Updates in Jun 2023]** üéâA short version of the PyPOTS paper is accepted by the 9th SIGKDD international workshop on
Mining and Learning from Time Series ([MiLeTS'23](https://kdd-milets.github.io/milets2023/))).
Besides, PyPOTS has been included as a [PyTorch Ecosystem](https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/) project.

The paper introducing PyPOTS is available on arXiv at [this URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18811),
and we are pursuing to publish it in prestigious academic venues, e.g. JMLR (track for
[Machine Learning Open Source Software](https://www.jmlr.org/mloss/)). If you use PyPOTS in your work,
please cite it as below and üåüstar this repository to make others notice this library. ü§ó

There are scientific research projects using PyPOTS and referencing in their papers.
Here is [an incomplete list of them](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_ylo=2022&q=%E2%80%9CPyPOTS%E2%80%9D&hl=en>).
