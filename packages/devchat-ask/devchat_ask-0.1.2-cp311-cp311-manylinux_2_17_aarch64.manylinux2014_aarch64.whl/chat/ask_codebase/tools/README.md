# Introduction

This README file provides an example output of running the `search_code_pro` tool in the `chat/ask_codebase` project. The tool is designed to navigate complex code repositories and recommend relevant source files based on a user-defined question. In this example, the tool was run with the question "Where is the implementation of app.post interface?" on an Express.js codebase.

The `search_code_pro` tool has recently undergone significant improvements, making it more effective and efficient in finding relevant code. The key improvements include:

1. The tool now builds a knowledge base gradually as it analyzes each file. This accumulated knowledge is updated after each file analysis, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the codebase in relation to the user's question.
2. The tool now explicitly decides whether the accumulated knowledge is sufficient to answer the user's question. This helps to prevent unnecessary file analysis and makes the tool more efficient.
3. The prompt used by the tool has been narrowed down to focus on the user's question. This makes the prompt more specific and helps the tool to provide more relevant results.

## Example 1: express.js

The output below demonstrates these improvements in action. Remarkably, without any vector database searching, the `search_code_pro` tool is able to gather sufficient information to answer the question using just 4 LLM calls. This efficiency is a testament to the tool's ability to navigate and understand complex codebases, and provides a powerful resource for developers seeking to understand new or unfamiliar code.

## Example 2: helm

Command: `python chat/ask_codebase/tools/search_code_pro.py "I encountered an error during a Helm upgrade: \"Error: UPGRADE FAILED: release XXXXX-helm-chart failed, and has been rolled back due to atomic being set: cannot patch 'XXXXX-secret' with kind Secret.\" I'd appreciate assistance in locating the section of Helm's codebase responsible for this error. Specifically, I'm not just looking for the direct error message, but also the root cause in the code that triggers this error." ~/code/chat/data/helm`

Command 2: 

```
python chat/ask_codebase/tools/search_code_pro.py "In case helm upgrade fails its usually print the error message, the message can include sensitive data such as secrets or passwords.

I’m facing with an issue when one of the deployment parameters contains invalid certificate, this cause to an error and though helm printed the full error to the screen, including the json value which contains several secret keys. The output usually printed to external applications which other users has access as well.

Trying to execute helm upgrade and write the output to file nor dev/null wasn’t helpful, it’s still printed to the screen, this probably since the error occurs during runtime.
Also execute helm upgrade with dry-run didn’t help, since dry-run passed (dry-run doesn’t validate the certificate)

Can we control the output message, or any suggestion how to overcome such behavior?

See below and example (off course secrets masked)
