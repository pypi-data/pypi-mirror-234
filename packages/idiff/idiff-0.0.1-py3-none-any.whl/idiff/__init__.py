--------------
Improve DIFFractograms = remove background + noise from 2D diffraction patterns.

* Input:
    - 2D numpy array representing original/raw 2D-diffraction pattern.
    - The original patterns usually exhibit non-zero background + random noise.
* Output:
    - 2D numpy array representing clean/de-noised 2D-diffraction pattern.
    - The ideal clean diffraction pattern has no background intensity and noise.
