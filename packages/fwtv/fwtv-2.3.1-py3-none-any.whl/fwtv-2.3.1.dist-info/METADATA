# FactorialHR work time verification

![pyversions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/fwtv) ![implementation](https://img.shields.io/pypi/implementation/fwtv) ![status](https://img.shields.io/pypi/status/fwtv) ![pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/fwtv) ![dpm](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/fwtv)

This script verifies attendances whether they comply with german law. In particular, the following rules are verified:
- Whether the work time is longer than 6 hours without a break of 30 min
- Whether the work time is longer than 9 hours without a break of 45 min
- Whether the work time is longer than 10 hours without a break of 11 hours

It also provides a way to fetch the attendances of all employees from [FactorialHR](https://apidoc.factorialhr.com/docs) using a [company api-key](https://help.factorialhr.com/how-to-create-api-keys-in-factorial).

## Disclaimer

I do not guarantee that this package complies with german law all the time. Changes may occur anytime. Use at your own risk.

Errors where the time attended is 1 min above the limit are ignored, because factorial's automated time tracking is not precises enough.

## Usage

- Install the tool with `pip install fwtv`
- Run tool with `factorial-working-time`

### Preconditions

Preconditions errors are syntactical errors like an attendance that starts and end and the same time, or if a `clock_in` or `clock_out` parameter is missing.
