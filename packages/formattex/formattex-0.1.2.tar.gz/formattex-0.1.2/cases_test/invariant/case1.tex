First, one can see by considering the inviscid equation for the
vertical vorticity
\begin{equation}
\partial_t \omega_z + \vv \cdot \bnabla \omega_z = \bomega \cdot \bnabla v_z
\end{equation}
that this part of the flow is not directly influenced by a linear term related
to buoyancy and has therefore no wavy behavior. Second, for weak nonlinearity
levels, the poloidal component can be identified as being mostly waves.
