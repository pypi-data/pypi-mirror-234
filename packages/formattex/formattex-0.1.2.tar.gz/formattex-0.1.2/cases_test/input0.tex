Stratified flows forced by internal waves similar to those obtained in the Coriolis platform (LEGI, Grenoble, France) \cite{Savaro2020} are studied by
pseudospectral triply-periodic simulations. The experimental forcing mechanism consisting in large oscillating vertical panels is mimicked by a penalization

Two other experimentally feasible sets of parameters are investigated. A larger
amplitude forcing shows that it would indeed be possible to produce in huge
apparatus like the Coriolis platform stratified turbulence forced by waves for
small $F_h$ and buoyancy Reynolds number $\R$ of order 10.
